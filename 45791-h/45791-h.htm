<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The Parisienne, in her subtler phases, is a theme
for a feminist of genius; and this little book does not
venture upon the psychological deep seas.</p>

<p>Grave issues are tangled in the game of fashion-making;
but the world through which My Lady of the
Chiffons dances lightly to gay music reeks of frivolity,
and the story of the fashionable Parisienne and of the
haunts in which she obtains and displays her incomparable
frocks must needs be a story of folly and
extravagance, best told, perhaps, by snap-shots of the
inner courts of Vanity Fair.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pn center mid p1">FROCKS AND FEMININITY</p>

<p class="pn p2">Clothes and the woman we sing! Given the
themes, Paris is obviously the only appropriate
setting. Nowhere else do the kindred cults of frocks
and femininity kindle such ardent devotion. Nowhere
else are women so enthusiastically decorative. There
are women more beautiful than the Parisiennes, there
are women who spend as much money upon their clothes.
Pouf! What is beauty unadorned? What is beauty
adorned&mdash;provided it is not chic.</p>

<p>That crisp little monosyllable is sadly abused by our
Anglo-Saxon saleswomen, but it is a master word for
all that, a great word holding in solution the quintessence
of things Parisian. It means a subtle something
before which mere beauty is humble, and mere luxury
is banal. It means coquetry, audacity, charm. It
means a thing evanescent, impalpable, unmistakable,
absurd, adorable, a thing deliciously feminine, a thing
essentially of the world worldly.</p>

<p>That the word should be a French word with no
exact equivalent in another tongue is as it should be.
The Parisienne is the true "femme chic." She has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
secret and she realizes its value, makes a fetich of it,
devotes herself to it with a zeal that could flourish
nowhere outside of Paris. There are charming women
all over the world, but nowhere is femininity so conscientiously
occupied in being charming as it is in Paris.</p>

<p>Your true Parisienne begins her creed with, "I
believe in coquetry"; and by coquetry she means not
merely embryonic flirtation, but all that goes to make
sophisticated charm. She is coquette from her cradle
to her grave, from her first communion frock to her
last cap and shawl. She does not depend upon her
natural advantages, she is not unconscious, not simple.
She is deliberately, insistently charming, and to gain
that end she shows the infinite capacity for taking
trouble which amounts to genius. The ill-natured call
the result artificiality, and they are right; but the fine
art of the artificiality is a thing to conjure with, and
through its aid the Frenchwoman retains her charm
long after youth and its bloom are fled. Wit wears
better than complexion, and tact outlasts figure. Incidentally,
much may be done to patch up complexion
and figure if wit and tact are on hand to carry off the
counterfeit.</p>

<p>To be sure there is something a trifle depressing
about the faded ghosts of Parisian youth, the old ladies
of Paris who refuse to admit defeat, and, painted,
bejewelled, vivacious, defy the years.</p>

<p>Yes, there's a sadness in the struggle, a gentle melancholy
such as serves poets for rondels and villanelles,
but they are not sad, themselves, those old ladies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Paris. Bless your heart, no! They are gay, excessively
gay. They flutter their fans and toss their curled heads
and scatter wrinkled smiles and unwrinkled bon mots,
and succeed, after a fashion, in their aim; for they are
delightful, these faded, worldly belles. They keep their
youthful hearts, their keen wits, their absorbing interest
in men and things. They have not forgotten how to
be amusing; and, under their cleverly applied rouge
and powder and false hair and general artificiality, they
are still sympathetic, still witty, still wise. Not one's
ideal of placid old age, not, perhaps, the grandmothers
one would choose for the family tree, but delightful
companions still; coquettes who have outlived their
youth but not their finesse.</p>

<p>Perhaps the cult of coquetry which is the pervasive
spirit of French society would be impossible outside
the atmosphere in which it flourishes. It is a part of
Parisian tradition, it colours Parisian values, determines
Parisian standards. Insensibly the woman who lives
in Paris surrenders to this spirit though she may have
come of Puritan stock or of Roundhead ancestry. It is
in the air of Paris. If one cannot breathe the air and
assimilate the germs, one departs. That is all. One
returns to Boston or Kansas City or Glasgow or Tewkesbury.
Doubtless those women who flee from the insidious
assault lead lives more estimable than those who
succumb, but they do not learn the gentle art of coquetry
in its Parisian form. So much the better for the
quietude of Boston and Kansas City and Glasgow and
Tewkesbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>It is probable, highly probable, that the foreigner who
recklessly remains in Paris and invites the spirit of the
place will show her inevitable lapse from Puritanical
grace first in her underwear. French lingerie is the
sign and symbol of French femininity. It is the refinement
of luxury, the quintessence of coquetry.</p>

<p>To wear a fortune in a gown is something, but to
wear a fortune in lace and handwork and cobweb linen
hidden away under a frock demurely simple is more,
and the Parisienne adores "le dessous." Jewels she
may lack&mdash;though not for want of conscientious effort
to obtain them&mdash;but dainty petticoats she will have,
and, having them, she will wear them, and wearing
them, she will show them. Why not contribute to the
sum of humanity's simple joys?</p>

<p>An old lady from a little Missouri town strayed from
a Cook's party one day, at the entrance to the Louvre;
and, some hours later, a young countrywoman of hers
found her occupying one of the Champs Elysées chairs
and watching with fearful joy the stream of French
womanhood picking its way along walks still wet from
an all-night rain.</p>

<p>The old lady clutched the arm of her fellow American
and turned a puzzled face away from the passing show.</p>

<p>"My dear, just look at those petticoats and stockings!"
she gasped. "The creatures haven't any idea
of hiding them. I've been watching for two mortal
hours and there hasn't been a let-up yet. Some are
finer than others, that's all. But they're all showy,
and every single woman has her dress tucked up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
you can't miss them. When I saw the first ones I
thought I'd struck the French women you read about,&mdash;the
ones who aren't proper, you know, and I was so
interested; but then they kept coming so steadily that
I got all mixed up. Hundreds have gone by, all holding
their skirts like that and every one of them swishing
silk or lace ruffles and showing silk stockings,&mdash;and it
isn't humanly possible, even in Paris, that they're all
bad, now is it?"</p>

<p>Bad? Not the least in the world. They were merely
French. The petticoat of Pleasantville, Missouri, and
the petticoat of Paris are two separate and distinct
things, and the old lady had vaguely grasped an important
fact not down upon the Cook's party schedule of
information. The Parisienne is Paris. Incidentally
there are picture galleries and museums.</p>

<p>The amount of money spent on the "dessous" by a
Parisian woman of fashion is madly extravagant and
entirely characteristic. It is but a detail of that religion
of luxury whose high priests centre in the Rue de la
Paix. The average Frenchwoman has a thrifty and
frugal side, but the extravagant Frenchwoman spends
her money with a light-hearted gaiety and a maximum
of picturesque effect. The most prodigal patrons of
the great dressmakers and jewellers in the Rue de la Paix
are Americans, but the most brilliant figures in the
fashionable Parisian world are French. The born
Parisienne is the supreme coquette. She wears her
clothes with an incomparable air. There is a touch of
the actress in her, and in the matter of feminine fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
art can give points to nature, so the Frenchwoman wears
with artfully artless grace and naturalness creations
whose audacity would reduce a woman of any other
nationality to an awkward self-consciousness that would
ruin the effectiveness of the costume.</p>

<p>Even could one conceive of all the great French
dressmakers transplanted to another land, only in Paris
could the modes be successfully launched, for only there
can monsieur find the women who are ready and able
to carry off triumphantly even the most revolutionary
of creations, who have the courage and confidence to
exploit models strikingly novel&mdash;always provided those
models have beauty and cachet to commend them. It
is the Parisienne, too, who is willing to buy the most
extravagantly fragile and perishable of frocks and who
will wear them regardless of consequences; who will,
moreover, smile most cheerfully when, having fulfilled
its mission, the costly frock is crushed, drabbled,
ruined.</p>

<p class="b1">"It had <i>un succès fou</i>, M'sieu!" she says blithely to
the maker when she sees him next. That is quite
enough. A great success on one occasion justifies any
extravagance, and why allow a spoiled frock to obscure
an agreeable memory?</p>

<p class="p1">King Alfonso attended one of the famous race meetings
near Paris one day last summer, and all the smart Parisian
world turned out to do him honour. The display of
frocks and millinery was a notable one. The pesage
was crowded with women in the airiest and most elaborate
of summer toilettes and, suddenly, the heavens
opened and a torrent of rain poured down. Such a
scurrying and twittering; such little moans and shrieks;
such laughter and jesting! Bad temper? Not a bit of
it. Things were quite bad enough without losing one's
temper. So they chatted and joked and achieved bon
mots that almost reconciled them to the facts that their
rouge was streaked and their plumes were drabbled
and their curls were straggling and their frocks were
limp. The sun came out and the demoralized toilettes
emerged from under cover, mere wrecks of their former
beauty; but the wearers carried the situation off with a
good-natured vivacity to which no other women would
have been equal. The afternoon was a particularly
gay one, and the prevailing philosophy was voiced by
one little countess who was heard to say to a friend as
they stood waiting for their automobiles:</p>

<p>"The frocks are spoiled, absolutely spoiled. C'est
dommage,&mdash;but, ma chère, what an opportunity for
the petticoats and the feet, n'est-ce pas? Me,&mdash;I
found much consolation in the real lace in my white
stockings and in my new shoe buckles,&mdash;Va! One
sees, every day, the frocks. To-day, for the first time,
I know intimately the ankles of all my friends."</p>

<p>Possibly the countess gave her maid a bad quarter
hour after she reached home; but for the benefit of the
public she stood there, insouciant, smiling, debonair,
with her chiffon frock clinging forlornly to her shapely
little figure, with her tulle hat gummed to a disarranged
coiffure and its plumes drooping like funeral emblems
over her left ear, but with her spirits intact. Not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
nothing did she have some of the best blood of France
in her veins. It is sporting blood,&mdash;that best blood of
France.</p>

<p>Concerning the morals of French womankind, the
serious may write,&mdash;and the less they know about
Paris&mdash;provided they are Anglo-Saxon&mdash;the more
fluently they will write; for intimate acquaintance with
Parisian life and sentiment is sadly prejudicial to orthodox
Anglo-Saxon standards, and it is difficult to be
severe with the Parisienne if one knows her. One
disapproves of her, in certain of her phases, perhaps,
but one learns the tolerant shoulder shrug of her nation.
She is so very amusing, and Paris is, first of all, "le
monde où l'on s'amuse."</p>

<p>One may like Paris or not. One may choose to live
in Paris or to live elsewhere, but one thing the fair-minded
will all admit. This capital city of the kingdom
of Vanity Fair is gay. The Parisians have reduced
gaiety to a science, luxury to an art. There may be
tragedy behind the curtain; but, before the public, life
goes to a merry tune. It is quite possible that smart
society, the world over, is as rotten as our novelists,
dramatists, and preachers would have us believe; but,
at least, in Paris it is not dull. Where American smart
society is spectacular, French smart society is chic.
Even in the half world the distinction holds. The
demi-mondaine of New York&mdash;or the nearest approach
to the demi-mondaine which New York furnishes, for
our standards are uncompromising and we recognize no
"half world"&mdash;is vulgar. The demi-mondaine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Paris is&mdash;one can but have recourse once more to that
untranslatable comprehensive word "chic."</p>

<p>Immorality, we are solemnly assured, is none the less
immoral because it is not banal. Probably it is more
deplorable in proportion as it takes on attractiveness;
but we are not moralizing, merely stating facts, and the
fascination of the great Parisian demi-mondaine is a
well-established fact.</p>

<p>To begin with, she is the best dressed woman in the
world. Any of the famous dressmakers of Paris, who
are the world's arbiters of fashion, will tell you that.
She has the money and the taste, and with her, even
more than with the Parisienne of the beau monde,
being charming is a metier. She supplements natural
attractions with every resource of art. She is, as a rule,
clever, tactful, witty. Often she is brilliant, and the
nearest approach to the famous salons of old France are
to be found to-day in the homes of certain Parisiennes
who are frankly demi-mondaine or dwell in that middle
world twixt "beau" and "demi" where, sometimes, the
name "artiste" casts a broad mantle of charity over
irregularity of life. There are countesses and princesses
of the blood who play at salon making in Paris, and
who would be in the seventh heaven could they once
call under their roofs the famous men who flock to
certain salons where mesdames of the beau monde may
not follow. Great litterateurs, painters, sculptors,
musicians, scientists gather at certain informal evenings,
certain famous little dinners. And mark you, everything
here is comme il faut&mdash;yes, indeed. Let the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of morals who associates the phrase demi-mondaine
only with Tenderloin orgies revise his vocabulary.
Orgies of the familiar kind he can find in Paris. They
are easily found; but he will have considerable difficulty
in gaining admittance to the salon of the great artiste
whose life history has been, to put it mildly, unconventional,
or to the salon of the famous demi-mondaine.
Once admitted, he will need wit and worldly wisdom to
hold his own. One hears of little dinners where the
quantity of liquor drunk falls far below Tenderloin
standards, but where the poet of the moment composes
sonnets to his hostess's eyebrow; where the famous
composer replies to Madame's "A new song, mon chèr.
I must have a song all my own," by sitting down at the
piano and working out a chanson which all Paris will
be whistling a few months later; where the petted tenor
from the Opera sings street ballads, and the great
diplomat chats international scandal, and the successful
artist and feminist sketches portraits of his hostess
upon the fly-leaf of the autograph copy of the academician's
book which the author has just presented to her.</p>

<p>Yes; one hears of those happenings in the little house
at Neuilly or in the mansion on the Boulevard Malesherbes,
or wherever the rendezvous may be, and one
struggles vainly to adjust one's vision to the Parisian
perspective to understand the Parisian attitude toward
life. It is disturbing to find impropriety so devoid of
the lurid light in which melodrama pictures it. One's
moral vertebra softens in Paris.</p>

<p>But there are Parisiennes and Parisiennes. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the aristocrat of the St. Germain&mdash;and even aristocratic
virtue is not dull in Paris. There is the wife of the
millionaire tradesman. There are the women folk of
the great banking house. There are the ladies of the
diplomatic circle, there are exiled queens and resident
grand duchesses. There are the Americans. There
are the artistes. There are the demi-mondaines, the
cocottes. And there is Mimi. She is not the worst of
the group, this unimportant little Mimi, not the worst,
and by no means the least coquette; but she is not a
bird of fine feathers and does not belong in our story.</p>

<p>The great lady of Paris is grande dame to her finger-tips,
whether she nurses the traditions of the old régime
in her exclusive salon in the Faubourg St. Germain or
follows after such new gods as "le sport" and broadens
her visiting list to include the trades and arts,&mdash;provided
always that the trade and the art have paid well
enough to lift tradesman and artist above their metiers.
France loves genius, but for social success, in Paris,
genius is not enough.</p>

<p>One must have money, wit, and tact to succeed in
smart French society without the prestige of aristocratic
birth. If one has the birth in addition, so much the
better.</p>

<p>There are salons to which only those to the nobility
born are eligible, but they are few, and modern French
society is prone to go where it will be most skilfully
amused, where it will find the most luxury, the greatest
originality, the most volatile gaiety. The receptions of
the Duchesse de Rohan are impressive, her invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
are in the nature of patents of nobility, but the Comtesse
Pillet-Will's extravagantly original fêtes are more popular,
and the average Parisian élégante would rather
go ballooning with the exceedingly modern young
Duchesse d'Uzes than talk politics in the salon of
the Comtesse Jean de Castellane or listen to the
excellent music which the Comtesse de Bearn provides
for her guests. Not that one objects to politics and
music. Music is "très chic" as furnished in the salons
of the Comtesse de Bearn, the Marquise de Castrone,
the Vicomtesse de Tredern, and the other society leaders
who are noted for this especial variety of entertainment;
and, though the great political salon is a thing of yesteryear,
the Parisienne always takes an interest in politics.
It is a game, and she adores games, especially games in
which men are the counters. She is a born intrigante,
and here is a field for legitimate intrigue. Moreover,
many men are devoted to politics, and is not sympathy
the corner-stone of the foundation of that power over
men which is the breath of the Frenchwoman's nostrils?</p>

<p>So, many of the fair Parisiennes play at politics, but
few play so charmingly as does the Comtesse Jean.
Comtesse Boni de Castellane, too, has political pretensions,
and shows a devotion to the royalist cause all the
more vehement because grafted upon democratic birth
and training; but it is when they pay forty thousand
dollars for a week-end house party that the Boni de
Castellanes loom large upon the Parisian horizon.
Their salon is not epoch-making.</p>

<p>Parisian society dabbles in politics, music, art, spiritualism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
amateur theatricals, and a host of other things,
but it plunges bodily into racing. The Jockey Club of
France, which controls the turf in France, is a gentleman's
club, and its members are, with the exception of
a few rich bourgeois, representatives of the most aristocratic
houses of France. The Duc de Noailles, the Duc
de Dondeauville, Prince d'Arenberg, Duc de Fezensac,
Comte Pillet-Will, Vicomte d'Harcourt and a host of
other men as well known are on the list of membership,
and it is natural enough that the great racing events
near Paris should bring out the flower of Parisian society
as well as the heterogeneous crowds common to race
tracks.</p>

<p>"Le sport," too, imported from England and conscientiously
fostered for a long time before it showed
signs of taking firm root in French soil, is now a conspicuous
feature of Parisian social life; and golf clubs,
tennis clubs, polo clubs, etc., are the chic rendezvous
even for that large percentage of Parisian society which,
for all its vivacity, would not, under any suasion, lend
itself to active exercise. One does not look well when
one exercises too violently, and costumes suitable for
golf and tennis are not nearly as fascinating as those
that may be worn by lookers-on. Therefore, since
looking one's best is a sacred duty, and since attractive
frock wearing is the Parisienne's religion, Madame,
as a rule, prefers to look on. She has sporting blood,
but, as we have already said, she is, before all else,
"coquette."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE TYRANTS OF THE RUE DE LA PAIX</p>


<p class="pn p2">If one would write of Vanity Fair, one must write of
the Rue de la Paix and the Place Vendôme; for the
faithful worshippers of the vanities turn toward that
quarter of Paris as devoutly as a Mohammedan toward
Mecca. There the high priests of Fashion hold sway,
and women the world over acknowledge with reverent
salaams of spirit that there is no fashion but Paris
fashion, though ideas as to Fashion's true prophets may
differ.</p>

<p>Let no one speak lightly of the French frock. It has
been a world power, and its story, if adequately written,
would be a most absorbing and comprehensive one.
Drama of all kinds has clung round its frills and furbelows.
Revelations philosophical, historical, sociological,
lurk in its shimmering folds. Men have died for it,
women have sold youth and honour, husband, child, and
lover, for it. It is Fashion's supreme expression, and,
on the altar of Fashion all things precious have, first
and last, been offered up.</p>

<p>Even the French scarcely realize the vital issues involved
in the making of the Fashions, but they, at least,
approach the matter with becoming gravity. Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
are said to be, next to the French, the best dressed women
in the world; but there is a certain lamentable levity in
the American attitude toward dress, while the French
take everything pertaining to clothes seriously. One
need only read a page from one of the best French
fashion journals to grasp the national point of view.</p>

<p>Here is no mere curt chronicle of the modes. The
writer's rhapsodies put our spring poets to shame.
Called upon to describe a creation in pink taffeta, he
dips his pen in May morning dew and invokes the muses.
He soars upon the viewless wings of poesy, and, soaring,
sings impassioned chants of praise; he culls his similes
from all the realm of beauty, his adjectives glow with fervour,
he quotes from the classics, he draws upon history
and fable, he winds up with a fervid apostrophe to fair
woman,&mdash;and not one of his French readers smiles.
They see no extravagance in his periods. The pink
taffeta was from Paquin. Upon what shrine could
flowery tributes more fittingly be laid?</p>

<p>The artists of the French fashion journals approach
their work in the same spirit. One uses the word artist
advisedly, for they are really artists, those men who
picture modish femininity for the Parisian fashion
journals of the highest class. On this side of the water,
fashion illustrators, with one or two exceptions, attempt
nothing more than an accurate reproduction of the details
of frock or wrap or hat. There their whole duty ends,
and as for producing a clever and charming drawing,&mdash;perish
the thought! The artist who can do that scorns
fashion work; or, if he condescends to it, ranks it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his advertisements for soup or sapolio, and refuses to
honour the pot boilers with his signature.</p>

<p>"They do these things better in France." There, a
man may have studied seriously, may have seen his
pictures given place on salon walls, and yet may take
pride in being one of the foremost fashion illustrators
in France. For example, there is Fournery. He is,
perhaps, the most popular of the French fashion artists;
he commands large prices, has more orders than he can
fill, is independent to the last degree&mdash;and he loves the
work, puts into it the best of the skill that he has acquired
through earnest study, the skill that has won him
a place in the salon, when he has taken time from his
serious fashion work for such frivolous side issues.</p>

<p>He is a feminist, this artist. Everything that goes to
make up feminine coquetry and charm interests him.
He is willing to draw a picture of a fashionable frock,
for the joy of drawing the woman who can successfully
wear it. The "femme chic" is his chosen theme. If
editors pay him large sums for gowning his women in
certain costumes, so much the better.</p>

<p>A visit to Fournery and a study of his methods would
suggest a new point of view to the American artist who
thinks anything will do for a fashion sketch.</p>

<p>One finds a delightful studio, a vivacious and enthusiastic
young man,&mdash;French to his finger-tips.</p>

<p>"You want to know how I do my work? A la bonheur!
It is quite simple, my method. I draw first the
nude figure,&mdash;from life, bien entendu. One must have
the perfect figure before one can display the frock at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
best, n'est-ce pas? A wooden woman cannot show off a
beautiful gown. The wearer must be graceful, supple,
svelte, chic. When one has the woman one adjusts her
lingerie. One corsets her&mdash;but why not? The corset
is an abomination perhaps, but it is worn, and there
are corsets and corsets. Since women must wear corsets,
let them wear good ones. The fashionable figure is not
that of the Venus de Milo, but what would you? It is
the fashionable figure. The fashionable gown is made
to go over it. Voilà! My woman must be perfectly
corsetted upon the accepted lines, but with as little
violence as possible to nature's grace. Then the gown!
One fits it to the figure, one makes it cling where it
should cling, flare where it should flare, bring the
wearer's best points into view, as the wearer exhibits
the best points of the frock. One introduces an interesting
background. It must be cleverly drawn, that
background, a line here, a line there, nothing to distract
the eye from the figure but an appropriate setting,&mdash;a
glimpse of the pesage at Auteuil, the terrace at Monte
Carlo, a corner of the Café de Paris, a vista on the Avenue
des Acacias.&mdash;There you have it, Madame, my fashion
picture. Elle est gentille, n'est-ce pas, cette petite femme
chic?"</p>

<p>She is most assuredly "gentille." So is the "femme
chic" as Drian pictures her,&mdash;Drian the youthful, who
might stand at the head of our conscientiously monotonous
portrayers of pretty women, were he working in
New York instead of Paris. Many of those same
American exponents of feminine types draw badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
enough to shock the clever young Frenchman, but they
would marvel at his pride in his fashion work,&mdash;for
he is proud. He recognizes the importance of his
metier.</p>

<p>It is this popular attitude toward things sartorial that
has made Paris the centre of the dressmaking world.
The great dressmaker may be born anywhere, but even
a sartorial genius, born to dressmaking as the sparks fly
upward, will not come into his artistic heritage outside
of Paris. Your artistic temperament must have its sympathetic
environment, and only in Paris is the artist
dressmaker ranked with the immortals, only in Paris is
dressmaking classed among the fine arts. Worth, the
great, blushed unseen in the dark unfathomed caves of
Birmingham; Beer wasted his sweetness on the desert
air of Berlin; the Callot Sisters are from Provence and
owe to the land of Tartarin their bold originality of
invention; the Maison Drecol, famous in Paris and the
foundation of Viennese fashion, was established by a
Madame Wagner from Amsterdam. Once rooted in
Parisian soil, these insignificant ones waxed great and
famous, and their history is the history of fully two thirds
of the well-known Paris dressmakers.</p>

<p>They are the truly great men of France, those famous
dressmakers. Politicians, statesmen, generals, writers,
musicians, strut across the public stage and play their
rôles; but Paris could do without them. Given a grand
cataclysm, and a possibility of saving some one famous
man for the Republic, Paris would unhesitatingly rescue
Paquin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>There has been a revolution in the type of the illustrious
ones, during the last decade. Dressmaking has
its Champs de Mars; but, in its case, the new men have
almost driven the old salon to the wall.</p>

<p>Paris to-day has two distinct schools of great dressmakers,
the new and the old, but the survivors of the
old original type are few and far between. In the old
days the phrase "creative genius" was not amiss when
applied to the heads of the big French dressmaking
establishments. To-day these great men are business
men, but the men of the old school were artists, had
creative talent&mdash;in a fashion sense&mdash;and cultivated
that talent.</p>

<p>Walles, an Englishman by birth, was an extreme
example of this attitude on the part of the dressmaker
toward his art, though his name is not so well known to
the general public as many others. He was an artist
<i>enragé</i>, a genius in colour combination and line. He was
an avid student of colour, line, values, in the art galleries;
he spent day after day in the woods noting the colour
combinations of the autumn leaves; he drew upon
flower and bird and insect and cloud for inspiration, and
he achieved great results; but he had the ill-balanced
temperament of genius and his career was brief.</p>

<p>Madame Roderigues, a Portuguese&mdash;and an exception
to the rule that no great dressmaking talent has
come from Spain, Portugal, or Italy&mdash;was a phenomenal
artist of this same type, but ill health interfered with
her spectacular success.</p>

<p>Other dressmakers, not such extremists as these two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ranked with the artist group, but Worth was practically
the last of the old masters of dress.</p>

<p>The new men are of a different class. The work
turned out from their ateliers is as good as that of their
predecessors, but it is produced by different methods.
The head of the establishment to-day is, first of all,
a business man of extraordinary ability. He is also a
man of phenomenally good taste&mdash;but he is not a
creative genius. He does not lie awake wrestling with
embryonic ideas concerning sleeve or flounce or collar,
he does not roam woods and fields in search of inspiration.
Not he. He buys the brains of lesser folk and
launches the product of those brains for the edification
of womankind and his own glory. Some little ouvrière
in the workroom has a moment of inspiration. She
goes to her employer with her idea. If he likes it, he
buys it,&mdash;and she goes back to her work. Or perhaps
some obscure dressmaker with more originality than
reputation goes to one of the famous men and shows
him models she has designed. If she has anything to
offer which, in his judgment, has possibilities, he buys it&mdash;and
at a generous figure. These men are always
willing to pay liberally for ideas; but, once bought, the
thing is theirs. The originator must not repeat it nor
claim credit for it, though it may make the man who
buys it famous, and set the fashionable world agog.
Unfair? Not at all. The little dressmaker has not the
ability to launch her idea. She makes more out of it
by selling it to a well-known house than she could make
in any other way. In course of time she may become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the head of such an establishment, for the seats of the
mighty are filled chiefly from her class; but, in the meantime,
she is glad to find a market for her ideas.</p>

<p>The genius of the great dressmaker to-day consists in
appreciation of the possibilities in an idea. He may not
be able to conceive an original costume, but he knows
instinctively what is good, has taste and judgment that
are unerring. Out of a hundred models he will unhesitatingly
choose the one that has a chance of success;
and, having had the taste to select, he has the business
ability to exploit and sell.</p>

<p>Then too, the ultimate development of the chosen
ideas does rest in his hands. The seller of sketches or
of crinoline models has given him suggestions. It is
for him to bring forth from those suggestions creations
that will dictate to all the fashionable world. Robed in
a loose cloak of silk that will protect his ordinary clothing,
puffing a cigar that consorts ill with his classic toga,
the master sits in his workroom amid a chaos of materials
and trimmings. Around him cluster his chief aids,
exhibiting to him the experimental models turned out
in the workroom. Jove-like, save for the great Havana
tucked in a corner of his mouth, Monsieur lays down
the law, criticises, suggests, alters, experiments. A fold
is changed here, a frill is introduced there, materials are
selected and harmonized, trimmings and linings are
decided upon, names are given to the models at their
birth. If the exact material or trimming needed to
produce a desired effect is lacking, Monsieur does not
allow that to worry him. He will merely tell the manufacturer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to make what he wants&mdash;and the manufacturer
will do it. The great dressmaker can make or mar a
new fabric, and it is wise for the maker of dress materials
to humour the whims of the tyrant.</p>

<p>Under the régime of the old masters of fashion, the
head of the establishment was a sacred personality&mdash;a
being to be spoken of in hushed tones and approached
with tremulous awe. He hedged himself about with
mystery. He represented creative intellect at its highest;
and, when the intellect settled down to its sacred function,
nothing short of battle, murder, or sudden death
would present a satisfactory excuse for an intrusion upon
the privacy of the Master. Only a few privileged ones,
elect because of the size of their bills, their superlative
appreciation of true art or the worthiness of their faces
and figures, were admitted to the Presence, and they
accepted the honour in a spirit of true humility. If an
ordinary mortal, daring as Icarus, asked to see Monsieur
himself, Monsieur's representatives were tolerant, but
pitying. See Him! Impossible! So might the priests
of old have regarded a Cook's tourist, asking to be personally
conducted through the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>

<p>But Paquin and his followers have changed all that.
Ordering gowns is no longer an awesome function. It
is a soothing, delightful experience. One loses in religious
exaltation but gains in beaming self-content.</p>

<p>Paquin was perhaps the first, as he is the best known,
of the new school. Thirteen or fourteen years ago he
was a clerk on the Bourse with no more knowledge of
costuming than was to be gained by appreciative observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of <i>les belles Parisiennes</i>. Madame Paquin, who
was not yet Madame Paquin, had a little dressmaking
shop in an insignificant quarter. The two met, married.
A rich patron opportunely turned up and furnished
capital for an ambitious dressmaking enterprise. The
young couple opened a shop on the Rue de la Paix.
There was no sounding of trumpets nor beating of
drums, but with the opening of that little shop Paris
was well on the way toward another revolution.</p>

<p>To-day, Paquin stands at the head of the great dressmakers
of Paris. His word is practically law. "Paquinesque"
is the word coined to express all that there is
of the most chic.</p>

<p>"An ugly costume," says the first Parisienne.</p>

<p>"But no, ma chère, it is of Paquin," protests the
second.</p>

<p>"Oh, vraiment? But yes, I see. It has fine points.
Ah, mon Dieu, yes, it is charming," gushes the first
critic. So much for being the king who can do no
wrong.</p>

<p>The success was, first and foremost, a success of
personality. Monsieur Paquin is a handsome man.
His manner is a thing to conjure with&mdash;and he has
worked it to its conjuring limit. Madame Paquin is
pretty, she is gifted, she is charming. Everyone is fond
of Madame. From the first, this clever and ornamental
young couple followed a new system. No haughty seclusion,
no barred doors, at the Maison Paquin. Madame
was probably met at the door by Monsieur Paquin himself,
and to be met by Paquin was a treat. The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
beautiful of Parisian élégantes and the homeliest old
dowager received the same flattering welcome, the same
tender interest. There was no servility in the manner.
It was merely the perfection of courtesy. The customer
was enveloped in an atmosphere that was soothing,
delicious, promotive of deep self-esteem. Madame
Paquin continued the treatment. The charming woman,
the handsome man, both so deeply interested, both so
deferential, both so intelligent! This was a new experience.
The Parisienne smiled, purred, under the stroking,
bought more than she had intended,&mdash;and came
again.</p>

<p>Vanity is a lever stronger than awe. Paquin and his
pretty wife understood that fact and built upon it.
Feminine Paris chanted "The King is dead; long live
the King!" The revolution was accomplished.</p>

<p>The sincerest flattery is imitation, and Paquin has
been much flattered. A long line of more or less successful
Adonises have followed in his footsteps. But
Doeuillet and Francis are perhaps the most important
on the list.</p>

<p>Francis is young&mdash;in the early thirties. He is almost
as good-looking as Paquin. His manners are a Parisian
proverb and, personally, he is doubtless the most popular
man in his class. His customers adore him. What is
more surprising, his work people also adore him, and
even the touchiest of mannequins, prone to decamp at a
moment's notice, swears by Francis and refuses to leave
or forsake him. Ten years ago Francis was a poor
salesman. To-day he is rich. Tailor-made costumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
or the Parisian modification of the tailor-made, are his
specialty, and his coats and cloaks are famous. Doeuillet,
too, has won fame and fortune within a few years.
He, too, is young and handsome and ingratiating. Six
feet tall, with the shoulders of an athlete and the face of
a frank, honest boy, he, too, is a "lion among ladies."
Mention Doeuillet to a customer&mdash;she tells you of his
eyes. "Such soft, honest eyes, ma chère. One would
trust him anywhere, anywhere." The soft, honest eyes
have been a valuable asset. Doeuillet has the most
gorgeous dressmaking establishment of all that cluster
around the Place Vendôme. He caters to the ultra-extravagant,
who do not care what they pay. His gowns
are the elaborate ball gowns, the marvellous confections
seen at Maxim's, at the races, at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Ernest is another of the men of the new school; but
Armand is, figuratively speaking, the baby of the group.
On the first of September, four or five years ago, a
wealthy patron put an unknown young employee of a
silk house into the dressmaking business. The young
man was Armand. He had a modest atelier on a side
street. On March first he moved into the famous Saye
Palace on the Place Vendôme, the palace in which
Napoleon and Eugenie met for the first time, and there,
among the superb frescoes and splendid carvings, he
installed his luxurious establishment. Success, wealth,
in seven months! Verily, the dressmaking business has
its opportunities for the young man who combines business
ability and beaux yeux.</p>

<p>Paquin's income is estimated at from three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
thousand to four hundred thousand dollars a year.
Doeuillet makes as much, and even without the Adonis
characteristics, business talents may carry the Parisian
dressmaker to wealth and fame. The list of rich dressmakers
aside from "those delightful young men" is a
long one. The Callot Soeurs are possibly the most
expensive firm in Paris. Doucet needs no introduction
to Americans. Neither does Beer, who is considered
by many the greatest creative artist in dress of our day.
He has one of the historic palaces on the Place Vendôme,
and his salons are rich in the eighteenth-century bibelots
and furniture of which he is an enthusiastic collector.
Flowers are everywhere throughout the rooms, and in
the spring all of the many windows of the great palace
are abloom with blossoms growing in window-boxes.
Beer's mannequins, too, are vastly decorative, and this
establishment is typical of the luxury and extravagance
amid which the game of fashion-making is played.</p>

<p class="b1">La Ferrière has the most exclusive English trade as
well as Parisian vogue, and is Paris dressmaker, by royal
warrant, to Queen Alexandra. Madame Havet, Blanche
Lebouvier, Sara Meyer, Mademoiselle Corné, are famous
and wealthy. Rouff belongs near the head of the list
and is a lineal descendant of the old school. In his
establishment many of the traditions of the great old
men survive. M. Rouff is not always in evidence as
are the meteoric young men. To have an interview with
him is an honour, and he will refuse to see even the most
illustrious if his whim prompts him to do so. The ordinary
customer meets only his representatives. Perhaps,
during the interview, the curtains of the door will part.
A thin, dark, rather wild-eyed face will appear for an
instant and vanish. That is Rouff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Worth has a splendid trade, but it is largely a serious
one. The great English and French dowagers go there;
and Jean Worth, the present active head of the house,
wears, more or less comfortably, the halo of his illustrious
grandfather.</p>

<p>The dowager calls him a charming boy and says to
him, "M'sieu Jean, when your famous grandpapa was
alive, he made for me a light blue brocade that was most
becoming. I would like something of that kind"&mdash;and
M'sieu Jean repeats for age the light blue brocade
of youth. He creates an extremely beautiful light blue
brocade too, and he charges for it a price that would
have surprised his famous grandpapa. He is old school
by heredity, but he has modern commercial instincts, this
charming boy.</p>

<p>The prices of the average French frock have gone up
under the new régime, though extravagant sums were
always paid for particularly original creations. There is
practically no limit to the expense of dress to-day, and
spectacular prices are paid for spectacular costumes; but
the price of the great bulk of the gowns sold by the
famous makers ranges from one hundred and twenty-five
dollars to five hundred dollars, with the greatest sales between
one hundred and seventy-five and three hundred.
Certain firms refuse to make even the simplest frock for
less than one hundred and fifty dollars, and turn out few
costing less than five hundred. Small wonder that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Paris the great dressmaker is a personage, belonging to
the swell clubs, in evidence everywhere save in society's
exclusive circles, owning a superb country place up the
Seine, a seashore home in Normandy, a villa on the Riviera,
buying&mdash;as did one of the group this year&mdash;whole
blocks of houses in the most expensive quarter of
Paris, spending&mdash;as did another of the guild&mdash;twenty
thousand dollars upon one day's entertainment of a few
chosen friends, running handsome automobiles, driving
and racing fine horses, and, from his vantage point,
watching the flood of fashions which he has set flowing.</p>

<p>Yet the expenses of a big dressmaking firm are large,
as well as the profits. Few of the autocrats are themselves
practical dressmakers. They must hire work-folk
capable of carrying out, in perfection, the ideas they
wish to exploit, and expert cutters, fitters, sleeve hands,
skirt hands, etc., command high wages. Exclusive material
and trimmings are required in such an establishment;
nothing is skimped, nothing is omitted that would
add to the beauty of the frock and so sustain the reputation
of the house. Success, not economy, is the watchword.
A small army of employees is required in one
of the great houses, and the place is a veritable beehive
of systematized industry; but the patrons see only the
"front," and of the wheels within wheels even of that
smooth-running front, they have small idea.</p>

<p>Each dressmaker has his loyal and devoted clientèle,
and it is upon this faithful band that he counts for his
greatest profits, although the large floating trade, too,
brings in immense returns. Some women famed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
their taste and extravagance in dress refuse to confine
themselves to any one artist, claiming that each dressmaker
has his specialty and that it is wise to go for each
frock to the maker most successful in the creation of
frocks of exactly the type desired. The idea seems reasonable,
but there is much to be said against it. For the
woman with whom Parisian frocks are an incidental and
fluctuating supply, the system may work well enough,
but the woman who season after season buys lavish
outfits from French dressmakers will do well to put
herself in the hands of some one of the great men,
establish a thorough understanding with him, allow him
to study her personality, her needs, her possibilities. It
is in such study that the artist dressmaker proves his
title clear to the name "artist," and to achieve artistic
triumphs in dress it is not enough that one wears a
beautiful gown, one must wear a beautiful gown perfectly
adapted to one's individuality, a gown in which
one is at one's best. There are some women who know
instinctively their own requirements, but these women
are few, and even they can carry out their ideas only
through the sympathetic understanding of a dressmaker
who is master of his art. The average woman must
trust to the dressmaker for the desired results, and to do
this confidently and with a surety of obtaining his best
efforts, his most serious consideration, his most masterly
comprehension, she must be among his tried and valued
customers, must have given him opportunity to know her
well, to understand perfectly her needs.</p>

<p>All are fish who come to the dressmaker's net, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
woman who will pay the price may have the clothes; but
the woman who can pay the price and display the clothes
to the best advantage is the beloved of the Parisian
artist in dress. "One does one's best, of course, even
with the woman of no figure and of homely face," says
Monsieur, with a shrug of resignation, "but when a
customer is slender, graceful, beautiful, and knows the
art of wearing a frock&mdash;then it is a joy to clothe her,
then one puts one's heart into the work, then one is
inspired to flights. Ah, mon Dieu, yes, there are women
for whom one would make clothes without pay, were it
not necessary to divorce sentiment and business."</p>

<p>Many American women are upon this list of ideal
customers. In fact les Americaines divide the honours
with the famous demi-mondaines of Paris. Do not
shudder, Madame of the impeccable reputation. The
comparison extends only to the province of clothes, and
as we have said before, the great demi-mondaine of
Paris is the best dressed woman in the world. One of
the tyrants of the Place Vendôme put the matter clearly
in a recent interview:</p>

<p>"Our best customers&mdash;best because they spend most
freely and because they show our creations to the best
advantage, are the famous demi-mondaines of Paris.
You must not confuse the demi-mondaine with the
grande cocotte. La grande cocotte is another thing.
She dresses gorgeously, she spends money like water,
when she has it, but she is seldom well dressed. She is
merely spectacular. The perfection of extravagant simplicity,
the apotheosis of artistic taste,&mdash;that is for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
great demi-mondaine. She makes no mistake. Her
costumes do not jump at the eyes. They are perfection.
C'est tout. There are French society leaders who dress
as well, but they are few, and for that matter, the
demi-mondaines belonging to the class of which I
have been speaking are also few. One can count
them on the fingers of the hands, those demi-mondaines
who really influence the fashions."</p>

<p>"And the Americans?" queried the interviewer.</p>

<p>"Oh, they are charming, les Americaines. We depend
upon them. They cut more figure with us than any
other dames et demoiselles convenables&mdash;respectable
matrons and maids&mdash;on our books. Some are bizarre.
Yes, of course. There are parvenues in America as
elsewhere, more there, perhaps, because there are more
quickly made fortunes in America. But many of the
Americans have a genius for dress, and the money to
indulge their tastes. They appreciate good clothes and
wear them well. Me, I adore les Americaines."</p>

<p>His ardour was heartfelt, as it might well be, for
millions of dollars had been poured into his coffers by
American customers. One of these women, whose fortune
is American, though its possessor elects to live in Europe,
orders, on an average, from one hundred to one hundred
and fifty gowns a year, the prices running from one hundred
and twenty-five dollars to two thousand dollars.
Even the great man lowered his voice when he mentioned
these figures. "Voilà une cliente précieuse. Voilà,
certes, une cliente précieuse," he murmured reverently.</p>

<p>From all over Europe, and from farther afield, women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
flock to the dressmakers of Paris. The Hungarian and
Polish and Viennese women of fashion have a reputation
for dress, and some of the Russians spend fabulous sums
upon the Rue de la Paix. Many English women of
fashion buy almost all of their frocks in Paris, and within
the last few years the German trade has assumed unprecedented
importance in the dressmaking establishments
of Paris, but neither the English nor the
Germans as a class have a talent for dress, and the
English or German woman who attains the effect to
which the French apply the comprehensive term "chic"
is the exception rather than the rule.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE FAMOUS ATELIERS</p>

<p class="pn p2">The dressmaker of Paris is an artist. Granted that,
it is quite natural that his workroom should be an
atelier. Your true artist works in a studio, not in a
shop; and when one speaks of the famous ateliers of
the Parisian dressmaking world, one but gives the work
done in these establishments its due recognition.</p>

<p>But they are "magasins" as well as ateliers, those
establishments in which fashions are made, and business
plays quite as important a part in them as does art,
though even the business in some of its phases approximates
the dignity of a fine art.</p>

<p>The saleswoman of the great dressmaking establishment
is certainly an artist in her line, and perhaps it
would not be speaking extravagantly to call her the
shrewdest business woman in the world. She is the
chief figure in that department of the establishment
which meets the public eye and which is designated as
the front. Upon her depends the successful disposal of
the creations which are tediously evolved behind the
closed doors, and her work calls for no ordinary ability.
Her knowledge of things Parisian is equalled only by
her knowledge of human nature, her suavity is equalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
only by her diplomacy. Her siren song would make
the mermaiden's melodies sound like a hurdy-gurdy.
She could sell a ten-thousand-dollar sable coat to the
savage owner of a hut on the equator&mdash;provided she
knew that the savage would be good for the ten thousand
dollars. And she <i>would</i> know. That's the amazing
thing about her. She always does know, or if she doesn't,
she finds out by some lightning quick process painless to
the customer. She makes no mistakes, this soft-voiced,
smiling, carefully groomed, persuasive woman, and yet
there is such opportunity for mistake in Paris. It is not
only a question of knowing the financial rating of the
husband of Madame A, or of the Countess B. The
credit system of a Parisian dressmaking house is a more
complicated thing than that. When Mademoiselle
Blanche of the Scala, at fifty francs a week, drives up in
a luxurious carriage, with coachman, footman, maid,
and poodle all in attendance, sweeps into the show rooms
and begins talking of five-thousand-franc gowns, the
saleswoman shows no surprise. She only wonders and
then adroitly institutes a search for the explanation.
The chances are that she can get the story from Blanche
herself, by dint of diplomatic wheedling and flattery.
If not&mdash;well, there are other ways of finding out before
the material is cut.</p>

<p>And when everyone knows that the Grand Duke has
loved and ridden away from Antoinette of the Folies
Bergère, yet Antoinette turns up smiling and places extravagant
orders, one must not be too hasty. A
grand duke may be succeeded by a rich banker. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
if there is no visible guarantee of the bills, the little
woman should not be angered. The future may hold
other grand dukes.</p>

<p>Not highly moral, these calculations, but supremely
Parisian. Business is business, and Parisian business
is adapted to Parisian conditions. The dressmaker does
not concern himself about the source from which the
money floods his tills, so long as the money is forthcoming,
and tainted money scruples would sadly demoralize
the business prosperity of the Rue de la Paix.</p>

<p>There are black books in the great dressmaking establishments
and queer things are entered in them, items of
information that would furnish spicy running commentary
upon Parisian life. The incomes of Monsieur's
customers are so often fluctuating things. Even in the
beau monde there may be circumstances not generally
understood, and, where no touch of scandal enters into
the calculations, still there is room for mistake. Fortunes
may rest on tottering foundations, appearances are often
misleading. Yes, there is much to confide to the black
book, and the dressmakers interchange statistics in
right comradelike fashion. There are men employed
whose business it is to investigate all matters having a
bearing upon the financial condition of the women who
make up the clientèles of the famous dressmakers, and
it might surprise some of the gay butterflies that flutter
into the luxurious salons of the dressmaking establishments
to know how thoroughly informed concerning
their private affairs are the saleswomen who wait upon
them and the "master" who caters to their whims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The saleswoman is as clever in dealing with Miss
Millions from Chicago as with the irrepressible Toinette.
She flatters so subtly, influences so insensibly, makes
herself so indispensable. Madame must never be made
to feel that her own taste is bad, but she must, if possible,
be guided to wise selection, persuaded to believe that
she herself has decided upon the frock she finally chooses.
It is to the interest of the house that every woman who
buys her frocks there should look her best. Moreover,
the woman whose friends praise her clothes will hold
fast to her dressmaker, so the saleswoman does her best,
and unless the customer is very obstinate, that best is
surprisingly good. If necessary, with an old and valued
customer the diplomat can be firm, suavely, politely firm.</p>

<p>"Why have I no black gown on the list?" asks
Madame, after studying the plan of her season's outfit
as made out by Mademoiselle Therèse.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle smiles, a deprecatory little smile, but
her reply is prompt.</p>

<p>"We find that this year Madame is not of an age to
wear black," she says simply, sweetly, but with a finality
in her tones.</p>

<p>Madame colours, looks resentful, Mademoiselle busies
herself with orders to a mannequin. The pause is
ended by a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>"Oui, c'est vrai," admits Madame. "There is an
age, and there is again an age, but in between&mdash;eh,
bien, it is true. We must now be careful, Therèse."</p>

<p>The successful saleswoman gains the confidence of
her customers, holds them, brings millions of francs'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
worth of business to her employer, and receives a commission
on all sales. One saleswoman, among the best
in her class, makes as much as fifteen thousand dollars a
year out of her commissions, and, though this is exceptional,
all earn good incomes.</p>

<p>The mannequins or models are the secondary features
of the "front"; but they are of little importance compared
with the saleswomen; and while it is a difficult
thing to replace a good saleswoman, satisfactory mannequins
may be had for the asking.</p>

<p>They are usually recruited from the ranks of the
errand girls who swarm in all of the large dressmaking
establishments, and are a sharp-witted, precocious set of
gamins wise in the gossip of the atelier which is the gossip
of all Paris. One of these girls grows up into a good-looking
young woman with an admirable figure, a forty-four-inch
skirt length, a twenty-one-inch waist, and a
soaring ambition. She attracts the attention of the
powers that be and is transplanted from her inconspicuous
place behind the scenes to the full glare of the
front. No more trotting about in pursuit of elusive
colours and materials, no more delivering messages and
frocks at all hours and in all weathers, no more being a
shabby little atom of humanity at everyone's beck and
call. Henceforward it is her sole duty to be chic, to
wear with an air that will lend cachet to the creations
any frocks or wraps which the saleswoman wishes to
show.</p>

<p class="b1">Much of the talk concerning the transcendent charms
of the Paris mannequins is great nonsense, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
sensational tales of these humble beauties and their
spectacular marriages&mdash;or "arrangements," are, as a
rule, pure fabrication. There are handsome girls among
them, and one and all they have the French talent for
wearing smart clothes; but their good looks are largely
a matter of make-up and of those same smart clothes.
A more ordinary looking group of girls than the mannequins
of a house, when they arrive in the morning, it
would be hard to find, but a half hour in a toilet room
works a transformation, and when Mademoiselle, perfectly
corsetted, skilfully made up as to complexion,
eyes, and brows, with her hair dressed in the latest
fashion, her hands and nails beautifully cared for, her
feet clad in dainty high-heeled slippers, sweeps across
the show room wearing a frock that is a dream of
beauty&mdash;then one understands how the traditions concerning
her have arisen. She is not beautiful perhaps,
but one forgets it, for she is excessively chic, and being
that she fulfils the French law and gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">A few mannequins have developed into saleswomen,
a few have married well, a few have become notorious
cocottes; one became a favourite attendant of Queen
Victoria, and finally drifted over to New York to end
her days there. A number have found unimportant
places upon the French stage, but, in the main, the
mannequins are very ordinary young women whose history
is but the history of the average Parisian working
girl. Perhaps it is demoralizing, this constant masquerading
in costly finery meant for others. One cultivates
a taste for luxury under such conditions, and when six
o'clock comes the rôle of grub must seem hard to the
girl who has been the most gorgeous of butterflies all
through the day. One works hard and lives shabbily
and is virtuous&mdash;but among the customers for whom
one trails silken draperies up and down, up and down,
there are so many who have the fine clothes for their
own, who live luxuriously, gaily, and who do not trouble
about that tiresome virtue. Bernard Shaw is right. It
is ill paid in a worldly sense, the virtue, and if the mannequin
has that fact forced upon her by the show that
passes before her&mdash;well, it is but one of the lessons of
Vanity Fair. As we have said before, French frocks
will have much to answer for when accounts are summed
up.</p>

<p>The mannequins' ball gives to the mannequin at least
one opportunity during the year for playing her rôle of
élégante outside the establishment in which she is employed.
For the truly great houses there is little object
in furnishing costumes for this ball, save only the giving
of pleasure to favourite employees, but gorgeous confections
are provided for the occasion, and the spirit of
rivalry twixt the different ateliers runs high.</p>

<p>Sometimes, too, pretty mannequins are commissioned
to wear model frocks at the great racing events or on
other occasions when all the fashionable Parisian world
turns out to see and be seen; but as a general thing,
Mademoiselle's sphere of usefulness is limited to the
salons of the firm that employs her. The days are not
so dull even there. All sorts and conditions of women,
save only the women without money, pass in and out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
One sees the famous beauties, the most notorious demi-mondaines,
the most celebrated artistes, the princesses
and grand duchesses and queens, the wives of the rich
bankers and manufacturers, the heroine of the latest
scandal, the newest love of a crown prince, the American
of fabulous millions,&mdash;the mannequin knows them all,
so does the saleswoman, so does the page who opens the
door, and the procession is an amusing one for onlookers
who have the key to its humours. Ah, the very walls are
saturated with gossip in the salons where Fashion makes
her headquarters, and when an old customer disappears,
when a new luminary arises, even the curtains flutter
with interest and conjecture.</p>

<p>Stars of a certain type rise and set swiftly in Paris.
Of a sudden, there is a new sensation. Some woman by
force of beauty, wit, diablerie, sheer audacity, has caught
the public eye. All Paris talks of her, men pour fortunes
into her grasping little hands. She eats and drinks and
is exceedingly merry. Her jewels are a proverb, her
costumes beggar description, her sables would do credit
to an empress. She has her handsome house, her horses,
her carriages, her servants. Wherever she goes she is the
cynosure of all eyes, and then&mdash;Pouf! she is with the
snows of yesteryear. Paris has a new sensation. La
belle Margot? Oh, yes; she had <i>un succès fou</i>, but that
was yesterday.</p>

<p>"Where is Felise?" asked an American who had not
been in Paris since the season two years earlier, when
Felise was the lionne of the day. The Frenchman to
whom he spoke shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, mon ami, how can one tell?&mdash;picking rags for
aught I know,&mdash;but have you seen Suzanne? Ravissante,
mon chèr! Paris is at her feet."</p>

<p>They are good customers of the dressmaker when they
are on the crest of the wave&mdash;these creatures of a day,
whom the French misname "filles de joie." When their
day is over and their credit is gone there is an entry in
the black book. The familiar carriage appears no more
at the door&mdash;but there are other carriages, other customers
to take the vacant place. The performance is a
continuous one in Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>There are fine distinctions made in regard to the
customers who flock to the famous dressmaking establishments.
Not for everyone are the choicest models
brought to light. These are for the delectation of the
elect, for known and cherished customers, for others
whose custom is a thing greatly to be desired.</p>

<p>Not until she is sure that the visitor is worthy of the
lure does the saleswoman order the mannequin to show
these exclusive models. She is eternally vigilant and
can recognize a dressmaker in search of ideas rather
than of frocks, or a woman moved by curiosity rather
than by a desire to buy, as far as she can see her. There
are many such visitors and they are treated civilly, but
they see little for their pains and they are not encouraged
to linger.</p>

<p>Then there is the woman of one frock, the casual
tourist who is seeing the sights of Paris and feels that
she will not have completed her programme satisfactorily
unless she takes at least one French frock home with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
her. She is not received with effusion, rather with a
good-natured tolerance, yet the saleswoman's manner
toward her is far warmer than that accorded to the
visitor with no intention of buying. In the course of the
year, these small orders, a vast majority of which are
placed by Americans, foot up to an imposing sum total,
and the saleswoman is too shrewd a business woman to
underestimate the importance of small things.</p>

<p>What does Madame want? An evening gown, a
dinner gown, a visiting gown, a street frock? Madame,
somewhat embarrassed, thinks she would like a nice all-around
dress, something dressy, but not too dressy, a
dress to wear to luncheon or afternoon tea or theatre
or&mdash;</p>

<p>"Parfaitement,&mdash;a gown utile. Marie, the grey
crêpe; Elise, put on the black and white silk."</p>

<p>"Too youthful? But no, Madame. It is of a sobriety
that grey crêpe. Madame is even too young for so
serious a costume, but&mdash;since she does not wish anything
conspicuous&mdash;The grey suits Madame's complexion
and figure to perfection. It will serve for
occasions of all kinds, and it is chic, très chic. The
friends of Madame will recognize at once that it is of
Paris. The sleeve is all that there is of the latest, and
the skirt&mdash;Madame will observe how the skirt hangs.
It is our newest skirt. Madame will be satisfied&mdash;oh,
of a surety."</p>

<p>And Madame buys the frock or orders one made like
the model. She has been shown little else, but then the
saleswoman is clever enough to have brought out at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
start something that would actually be suitable and
becoming, so, though overawed and robbed of self-assertion,
the unimportant customer probably fares
better than if she had been shown many models and
left to her own devices.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, there is a stir in the entry, the door
opens, a woman elegantly gowned, aristocratic of air,
sweeps into the salon. The saleswoman's face is
wreathed in smiles of welcome, her air is eager, deferential.
Madame la Princesse wishes to see Monsieur?
But, certainly. He shall be called. In the meantime,
if there is anything one can show?</p>

<p>Mannequins are sent flying for the best models and a
long file of the young women promenades through the
room wearing frocks in which the illustrious customer
may be interested. Monsieur comes out from the inner
fastnesses and declares himself enchanted, honoured;
materials are brought out and displayed, trimmings are
suggested. The interview is a very serious one. No
smallest word of the Princess is treated lightly. A
beggarly dozen of frocks, all extravagant in price, are
planned. A few costly furs are thrown in for good
measure. The Princess rises languidly. Monsieur himself
accompanies her to the door, and in the hall she
passes La Petite Fleurette, who has danced herself into
notoriety and into the heart of the Prince whose name
and title Madame la Princesse bears. Evidently this is
to be an expensive day for his Royal Highness.</p>

<p>Fleurette, too, is received with smiles, with effusive
greetings. The credit of his Royal Highness is excellent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Monsieur stops on his way to his private rooms and
returns to greet the danseuse. His manner to her is
not what it was to the Princess. Quite as cordial, yes;
but more familiar. The grave deference has disappeared.
The saleswoman, too, is familiar. She calls
the customer "ma chère" and "ma petite," flatters her
openly, jests with her. The best in the cases is brought
out for Fleurette as for the Princess, but it is a best of
a more striking type, and the master artist's suggestions
are not those he made to the Princess. One is always
an artist, but one caters to the individual. Where
Madame la Princesse has ordered a dozen gowns, la
petite Fleurette orders a score, and when she goes Monsieur
accompanies her also to the door, but as he turns
he shrugs his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh la, la!" says the saleswoman, vulgarly, expressively,
as she meets his eyes, and a buzz of conversation
sounds from the corner where the mannequins are
gathered.</p>

<p>The popular danseuse, chanteuse, diseuse, of the
Fleurette type is usually a more profitable customer in
her private capacity than is the great actress. She is
the fad, the sensation of the moment, and her money
comes easily and plentifully. No ambitious productions,
no expensive theatrical experiments, eat up her income.
Her art is not of the kind that absorbs her thoughts and
hopes and dreams. It is a means to an end, and that
end is gay and luxurious living. So la petite Fleurette
spends her money prodigally in self-indulgence, and
much of it goes to swell the profits of those alluring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
establishments on the Rue de la Paix and the Place
Vendôme. Other chanteuses and diseuses there are in
Paris who take their art as seriously as Bernhardt takes
hers, and who make it, in its own way, as truly an art;
but here again one finds women too deeply interested in
their work to take an absorbing interest in chiffons.
They may dress well, but not extravagantly well; and
beside the splendours of Fleurette their mild sartorial
radiance will seem dim indeed.</p>

<p>Of the actresses who stand at the head of their profession
in Paris, Réjane is probably the best dressed,
spends the most money for her personal and unofficial
adornment. She loves pretty frocks and she wears them
well, off the stage as on it; but even she does not rival
in her toilettes certain lesser lights of the stage, for whom,
in her capacity as artiste, she may well feel a good-natured
contempt.</p>

<p>It is when the famous actress appears in a new play
that she becomes important in the dressmaking world.
Then, if you please, she is extravagant, exacting, full of
whims. Then she and her chosen dressmaker have
long and strenuous conferences, at which the most able
assistants of the master artist are present with suggestion
and advice. The play must be gravely, exhaustively
considered. If it deals with some historic period, the
fashions of that period must be studied down to their
merest detail and adapted to present needs. The physical
characteristics of the actress must have due attention.
She must be made to look her best,&mdash;but the
psychological subtleties of her rôle must also be taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
into account in the planning of her costumes. Oh
they are grave, very grave, the preliminary consultations
concerning the costumes for a new and important
rôle. Day after day, Réjane drives up to the door,
behind her white mules, and is closeted with the
master and his chosen aids. There are sketches,
crinoline models, materials to be viewed and discussed,
high converse to be held concerning points upon which
artiste and artist are not at one. Then come fittings
by the dozen, with Monsieur looking on, and the heads
of the departments called in to receive orders or suggest
improvements. The skirt drapery does not fall
as it should. Madame shakes her head. Monsieur
knits his brows.</p>

<p>"Ask Renoir to come here." The chief skirt hand
appears.</p>

<p>"Tu vois, Renoir, ça ne va pas. It is a horror, that
drapery. I have the air of a femme des Halles, n'est-ce
pas?"</p>

<p>Renoir goes down upon her knees, rips a stitch here
and there, gathers the material up in her quick fingers.
A touch, a fold, a lifting here, a dropping there, while
everyone watches anxiously.</p>

<p>The skirt takes on new lines, Madame looks over her
shoulder at her reflection in the mirror, and her frown
melts into a smile.</p>

<p>"Mais oui, c'est ça."</p>

<p>Monsieur smooths his furrowed brow, and the skirtmaker
endeavours to look modest as she hurries back
to the workroom, but she is proud, extremely proud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
It is something to surmount serious difficulties under the
eye of the master.</p>

<p>There is perhaps a miniature stage in one of the
fitting-rooms,&mdash;a tiny stage, but large enough for a
solitary figure in sweeping draperies, and lighted by
footlights as is a real stage. So much depends upon
those footlights. They may ruin totally the effect of a
frock lovely under ordinary light, just as they will make
the most perfect natural complexion look cadaverous,
and the stage costume must be planned with reference
to this problem of lighting.</p>

<p>Many dressmakers care little for the theatrical custom
and seldom make stage costumes save when a modern
society play is in question, but other houses cater largely
to the stage trade. Doucet makes more of the costumes
worn on the Parisian stage than any other one maker,
but Redfern has had great success in that line, and
Drecoll, too, has costumed some famous rôles, while,
when it comes to the modern society play, actresses turn
to any one of the autocrats who finds most favour with
them.</p>

<p>The première of an important production always
brings out, if not the great dressmakers themselves, at
least their official representatives, whose task it is to
garner fashion ideas wherever they are to be found.
Even a period play may furnish some idea in colour,
line, or detail that may be adapted to modern dress and
inspire a new mode, and the elaborately costumed
modern play is always interesting to students of the
modes. Sometimes an actress wears a new and original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
frock that catches the fancy of Parisiennes and launches
a mode, but, in general, the stage frock's influence is
limited to the inspiring of ideas for modes rather than
to the setting of fashions, and the stage trade is not of
great importance in the great game of fashion-making.</p>

<p>Professional buyers fill the salons at certain seasons
of the year, and are to be reckoned with seriously in the
business calculations of Monsieur.</p>

<p>In early spring and late summer dressmakers and
buyers from all parts of the world set their faces toward
Paris, but by far the largest element of the pilgrimage
is American. Every dressmaker of pretensions to-day
makes her trips to Paris at least twice a year, views the
advance season models, buys as many of them as she
can, lays in a supply of exclusive materials and trimmings,
and fills her note-book with ideas to be used for the
benefit of her home customers. Often during her summer
trip she takes a run to Trouville and to other
Normandy resorts where the tide of fashion is at its
highest as the summer draws to a close; and, in the late
winter or early spring, the Riviera is a famous hunting-ground
for fashions.</p>

<p>Before March brings the Auteuil races, Paris is, in the
eyes of the ultra-chic, a wilderness. Women charmingly
gowned may be there. The uninitiated may believe that
the latest creations of the French dressmakers' art are on
view. The elect know better. They understand that
the gowns being worn in Paris before March are the
gowns of yesteryear. They understand, too, that, all
through the Paris winter, spring modes are having their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
trial, but that this trial is going on in far-away summer
lands. The women who launch the modes, the exclusive
few who set the fashion, are already wearing toilettes
that will serve as models to the general public when
spring comes, but they are wearing them at the winter
resorts, each of which has its distinct season for the
European smart set, and it is not until Auteuil calls
fashionable folk back to Paris that the stay-at-homes
know what is upon Fashion's spring programme.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="break">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">FIFI AND THE DUCHESS ON THE TURF</p>

<p class="pn p2">For fashionable Paris, the season begins with Auteuil.
The first of the races calls all of the wanderers back to
the heart of Vanity Fair. It is the famous rally, the
great spring opening, the first important toilette display
of the season. The meeting is held as soon as winter
shows the smallest sign of relenting, and is never later
than March, sometimes as early as February; but whenever
it comes it marks the début of spring upon the
Parisian calendar.</p>

<p>The weather may be bitterly cold, but that makes no
difference to the Parisienne. She has prepared a costume
for Auteuil and she wears it.</p>

<p>"Elise, what is the weather?"</p>

<p>"But of a coldness, Madame. It is to freeze!"</p>

<p>"Eh bien, bring me my fur coat."</p>

<p>Change the frock? The idea doesn't even occur to
her. That is her Auteuil frock.</p>

<p>And so Auteuil usually offers a spectacle as picturesque
as it is incongruous. The day is bright and cold, or&mdash;more
probable supposition&mdash;the sky is lowering, and
there is a flurry of snow in the air. The grand stand
and pesage are not yet gay with blossoming plants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Tall braziers are set at intervals along the front of the
stand, and near them hover swarms of women drawing
sable coats together over frocks of chiffon and lace,
showing faces a trifle blue with cold beneath flower-laden
hats. They hold their chilled hands out to the
flames, these forced blossoms of spring, and they shiver
daintily and jest at their own discomfort and are altogether
gay and inconsequent and absurd. Here and
there the furs are thrown back to afford a deserving
public glimpses of a toilette well worth seeing; and it is
around the braziers that all Paris first gains an idea of
the fashions that are to dominate spring and summer.</p>

<p>Feminine Paris appreciates and improves the opportunity.
Nowhere in the world do races draw so large,
so mixed, and so enthusiastic a crowd of women as do
the races in "Parisi"&mdash;which, slangily speaking, implies
the district round about Paris, and takes in all of the
famous courses upon which the spring races are run,&mdash;Auteuil,
Longchamps, St. Cloud, St. Ouen, Massons,
Lafitte, and Chantilly.</p>

<p>It is a queer mixture, that feminine crowd. The
Royalist Duchess, Fifi of the Variétés, the rich banker's
wife, the stable boy's sweetheart, the famous actress, the
little milliner, the tourist, the great manufacturers'
women folk,&mdash;all are there, dressed in their best, gay,
excited, conferring with jockeys and touts and illustrious
members of the Jockey Club, quite impartially, in
their quest for tips, betting eagerly, coquetting still more
eagerly, showing their own frocks and studying those of
their neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Verily, on the turf and under the turf all women as
well as all men are equal, but nowhere is the mélange
more amazing than at the Paris race courses. "A
feminine pousse café melting into a cocktail," commented
one irreverent and thirsty American as he watched the
throng at the Grand Prix last year, and the description
was apt if inelegant. Fifi and the Duchess come nearer
meeting on equal terms in the pesage than they do in
any other one place. They are beautiful women in
beautiful gowns, vying with each other for the approbation
of the crowd. The Duchess would not admit
that, but the fact remains, and it is a fact, too, that the
honours frequently rest with Fifi.</p>

<p>During the last few years there has been a tentative
effort in the smart Parisian set toward simplicity of
dress for the races. The demi-mondaines having chosen
these occasions for reckless extravagance in dress, the
social elect said, "Let us mark a distinction by disdaining
rivalry in chiffons. Let us be chic, but with a difference,
with a severity."</p>

<p class="b1">The movement has perhaps had some slight effect;
but, on the whole, the cause is a lost one. It demands
abnegation of too strenuous a type. Madame may
sacrifice much to a principle, but not an opportunity of
displaying her most charming costumes where their
merits will find wide and enthusiastic recognition; and
the racing events are the ideal opportunities for such
display.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">The Day of the Drags</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The setting is in itself a delectable one, for all of the
courses near Paris are attractive. The grand-stands are
all ablaze with flowers. Women trail their gowns over
velvety turf and under shadowing boughs, or stroll along
wide promenades between high banks of blossoming
shrubs. Given sunshine and warm weather, a great day
at any one of the courses is a surpassingly gay sight, all
colour and motion and sparkle.</p>

<p>The grande Militaire, a steeplechase with gentlemen
riders up, is one of the most popular of the Auteuil
events, for the horses are ridden by officers from the
neighbouring garrisons, and both Fifi and the Duchess
"aiment le Militaire." The Day of the Drags, or coaching
parade, is another chic event, and the occasion for a
phenomenal toilette exhibit. One is so delightfully in
evidence upon the box seat of a coach that one's most
charming frock and hat will not be wasted there. Moreover,
the competition in dress is more limited than it is
in the pesage or the Tribune, and, naturally, is all the
keener for the concentration. Seats upon the coaches,
which are tooled out to the race track by their famous
owners and greeted with traditional and impressive
ceremony, are eagerly coveted, and many a mode has
been launched from the top of a coach, many a new
belle has entered into her kingdom behind four curvetting
horses on the Day of the Drags.</p>

<p>But the day of days for the Parisienne who follows the
races&mdash;and what true Parisienne does not?&mdash;is the
day of the Grand Prix. The Grand Prix is the dramatic
conclusion of the season to which Auteuil was the triumphal
introduction. It is the climax to which St.
Cloud and St. Ouen and Chantilly and the rest have led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Auteuil is likely to be stormy. One expects that, but
bad weather for the Grand Prix is a tragedy. For
weeks, dressmakers and milliners have been at work
upon Grand Prix toilettes, and certain women,
famed for their beauty and the inimitable grace with
which they wear their clothes, might have the choicest
products of the ultra-swell ateliers merely for the wearing
at the Grand Prix, did they but choose to accept
the favours and organize themselves into advertising
agencies. Every woman with money to spend, spends
as much of it as she can spare upon her toilette for this
one occasion. She will blossom out gorgeously for
Grand Prix, if she goes shabby during the rest of the
year.</p>

<p>Oh the heartburnings, the jealousies, the opera bouffe
dramas that are woven round those Grand Prix gowns,&mdash;the
solemn conferences with the great dressmakers,
the whispers and rumours about the frocks of rival
beauties, the eager interest of all the Parisian world!
In the ateliers nothing is talked of save the coming
event. From the smallest errand girl to the master
artist, all have the interests of the establishment at
heart and are curious regarding the achievements in
other workrooms. To have turned out a majority of
the frocks which create a sensation at the Grand Prix,&mdash;that
is a triumph surpassed only by the winning of the
Grand Prix itself.</p>

<p>So the dressmakers outdo themselves in aspiration
and effort, and when the great day comes they go to
Longchamps to sit in judgment upon their own creations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and those of their rivals. They bet upon the horses,
yes; but they realize that the race is run in the Tribune
and the pesage, not upon the track, and as for the two-hundred-thousand-franc
purse that goes to the owner of
the winning horse&mdash;two hundred thousand francs would
carry Madame but a little way on her race for fashionable
prominence. Ten thousand dollars' worth of lace went
into one frock worn at the Grand Prix last June and the
ropes of pearls worn over the lace were worth a prince's
ransom, yet the toilette was a quiet one. Only the
initiated could appraise its value&mdash;but, fortunately for
the wearer, in the matter of clothes, Paris is a city of
initiates.</p>

<p>There are strenuous times in the boudoirs of Paris on
the morning of the Grand Prix. Both Fifi and the
Duchess are hard to satisfy, and their maids walk on
tiptoe and breathe but lightly until the last rebellious
lock is brought into subjection, the last sustaining pin is
thrust through the tip-tilted hat, the last touch of powder
is applied to the pretty nose, the last fold of the veil is
coquettishly adjusted.</p>

<p>Madame surveys herself conscientiously, exhaustively.
Not a detail escapes her, and, if all is well, she sighs,&mdash;a
sigh of supreme content. She has done what she
could. Dressmaker, milliner, and maid have done
what they could. Le bon Dieu also has had a share in
the satisfactory tout ensemble. Mentally, Madame includes
all in a sweeping vote of thanks, but the maid is
nearest at hand.</p>

<p>"Celeste, you may have the blue silk frock you like&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
one with the embroidery. Yes; and the blue parasol
also."</p>

<p>She is gone, in a flutter of laces and chiffon and plumes,
and the exhausted maid stops only long enough to
appropriate the blue silk, before hurrying out to the
Bois where she may see the passing show, or joining
Jacques and setting forth&mdash;she also&mdash;for Longchamps.</p>

<p>The parade to the Grand Prix is well worth seeing,
even if one cannot see the race itself. Out the broad
avenue of the Champs Elysées streams the procession,
coaches, automobiles, smart traps of all kinds, hired
fiacres, high-stepping horses, dapper drivers, exquisitely
gowned women, merry-makers of all types.</p>

<p>Past the Place de l'Etoile they go, where the avenues,
radiating in all directions, pour tributary streams of
humanity into the already swollen tide. Out along the
Avenue du Bois and through the gates, past Armenonville,
past the cascades, on to Longchamps!</p>

<p>There is the smooth green stretch, there is the pesage
already crowded with fashionable men and women,
jockeys, sports, gee-gees (as the French bookies are
called). There is the Tribune, closely packed and
glowing like a Dutch tulip-garden with colour. Groups
of women, arrayed with a subtlety of elegance of which
Sheba's queen never dreamed, are clustered under the
lindens, everywhere flutter the colours of the various
starters,&mdash;which are the colours of the great families of
France; for the Grand Prix is run under the auspices of
the Jockey Club of France, and the Jockey Club, as has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
been said before, is the gentlemen's racing club par
excellence.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because the horses belong, as it were, in
her own set, perhaps because she and her world follow
the racing season so closely, that the average Frenchwoman
of society knows more about the horses than her
American or English sister, and places her bets right
cannily; but the Parisienne at large is quite as eager
over racing, and puts up her money with quite as much
zest as does my lady of legitimate Jockey Club connections.
She is a born gambler, the little Parisienne, born
to gambling as to all forms of excitement, to all that is
recklessly, feverishly, uncalculatingly gay; and she bets
upon the Grand Prix, if not again through the year.
She may wager louis or francs, but she places her stake
with smiling audacity, and takes her losses or gains
sportily.</p>

<p>Each year, after Grand Prix, the air of Paris is full of
stories of feminine plunging, and many of the stories
would make spicy reading could they be told with the
names attached.</p>

<p>There, for instance, was the American actress who lost
the ten thousand dollars borrowed for her new production,
and could not get her ordered gowns out of the
hands of her dressmaker until she had made a flying trip
to New York and succeeded in raising money enough to
pay for them.</p>

<p>There was the French danseuse who, through a jealous
rival, obtained a tip that was pure fabrication, but purported
to be a sure thing emanating from a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
source. She did what she was expected to do, staked
every franc she could get together upon a horse quite
out of the running, and was the only one not surprised
when she found herself one of the handful who had
backed a winner, and provided with money to throw to
the birds. And there was the story of the little Countess
of high degree who pawned the family diamonds for
money to risk on a sure tip from a famous jockey, and
who came a cropper that was offset only by the spectacular
winnings of her husband's bonne amie on the
same race.</p>

<p class="b1">Yes, the air is full of such stories and the scandal-mongers
whisper them, chuckling; but they are hardly
pleasant stories, and sometimes tragedy looms grim in
the aftermath of the Grand Prix. For that matter,
tragedy lurks always just beneath the surface of Parisian
life, but on the surface there is such gaiety, such insouciance,
such a glitter and a fanfare, that one forgets. It
is absurd to be haunted in Paris. The ghosts are themselves
Parisian; and, recognizing the absurdity of their
metier, allow themselves to be decently laid while the
tide of life swirls over them and around them. Or, if
they do walk between the hydrangea clumps of Auteuil,
or under the lindens of Longchamps, or steal through
the corridors of the Grand Condé at Chantilly, they are
well-behaved, unobtrusive ghosts, unnoticed in the whirl
of brilliant colourful life.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Down in the pesage at Longchamps there is no question
of ghosts on Grand Prix day. Sunshine, laughter,
life at its merriest, rule the day. The Parisienne's
grand passion is for diverting herself and others. She
is the queen of luxury and of gaiety, and she plays her
rôle royally at the Grand Prix. "Parisienne," one says,
but one means the woman of Paris, not the woman born
in Paris; for Paris is cosmopolis. The over-elaboration
of all civilization centres there. Her women are the
women from all lands, women of all types, resembling
each other only in sex and in their ready assimilation of
the best that civilization has to offer to the senses. The
spell of Paris, the witch city, is over them all.</p>

<p>In the paddock at Longchamps, one will see all the
well-known women of Paris, and not only of Paris but of
Europe. Homburg empties its cosmopolitan smart set
into Paris for the Grand Prix, St. Petersburg always
sends a large contingent, the racing folk of England are
out in full force, Americans are numerous; but perhaps
most notable of all are the Viennese. The Viennese
women are marvels. They can meet Parisiennes on
their own ground and at least share the honours. They
have superb figures, attractive faces, a talent for dress,
and, with all that, a certain vivacity, dash, vivid charm,
that makes them, in the estimation of many critics, the
most fascinating women of Europe, though they lack
the subtle tact and finesse, the swift wit and ready
adaptability, of the Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>There are grave faces in the crowd that waits for its
carriages and motors outside the pelouse after the race
is over, but they are the exception. If one has lost&mdash;well,
one must pay or must make someone else pay, and
meanwhile the great day is not over. The horse has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
played his part, one has lost or won, the sun is dropping
low in the west; but if one has lost, one can drown
regret; if one has gained, one must celebrate the victory.
The long night lies beyond the sunset, and Paris is at its
best under artificial light.</p>

<p>So the tide sets back toward Paris, along the channels
by which it came, and once more the green silence of the
Bois is shattered by the beat of hoofs, the roll of wheels,
the "teuf-teuf" of automobiles, the laughter and chatter
of a multitude. It has seen many sights, this famous
Bois, since the days when it was the quiet old forêt de
Rouvray, and, if the little green leaves could but speak&mdash;but
the budget of gossip is large enough in Paris without
such an avalanche of new items as the leaves could
supply.</p>

<p>For weeks beforehand every table in the fashionable
restaurants has been reserved for the evening of the
Grand Prix. Armenonville is crowded to its limits.
The Madrid, not so cosmopolitan but popular with the
French, has not a vacant seat. The Pavilion Royal,
the Cascade, and the other Bois restaurants are filled
with folk whose swellness is in proportion to the standing
of the place.</p>

<p>Down in the city, the Café de Paris has the crowd
corresponding to that at Armenonville, in the Bois.
Durand's, Paillard's, Voisins, the Ritz, the Elysées&mdash;all
have their quota of the patronage, and a host of
restaurants less famed in social annals accommodate the
lesser folk of the Grand Prix multitude. Everywhere
there is eating, drinking, and making merry, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
gives no thought to dying on the morrow. The hours
go lightly to the accompaniment of music and laughter
and the clink of coin, and when, after the dinner, the
diners move on to the theatres, no serious drama is likely
to claim them. Glitter, gaiety, and frivolity are the
keynotes of this June day from start to finish, and the
staid Comédie Française is left high and dry, while all
the "tingle-tangles" are packed to suffocation.</p>

<p>Les Variétés, Les Nouveautés, Le Mathurins and the
other Boulevard resorts, Les Ambassadeurs, l'Horloge
and places of similar type&mdash;these are the after-dinner
rendezvous for Grand Prix night, and every famous café
chantant in the city reaps a harvest. Then, when theatre
is over, a large percentage of the celebrating world
brings up at Maxim's. Folk who go there at no other
time drift in on that one night, and the crowd is a motley
one, a conglomeration of types, the concentrated distillation
of the variety, the extravagance, the gaiety of
Paris&mdash;reckless, feverish, pleasure-mad Paris.</p>

<p>So Grand Prix day ends; and, with it, according to
tradition, ends the Paris season. In the old days this
was true. The morrow of the Grand Prix saw the
fashionables packing trunks for the country, Brittany,
Normandy,&mdash;anywhere, everywhere, away from Paris;
but the flight was one of convention. Paris is at its
best in June, and the enjoyable weather is likely to last
on into July. The mad rush of social engagements is
over, so that one may relax and enjoy one's self in leisurely
fashion, may assume a social déshabille, go where
one will, do what one will. And Parisiennes have gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
taken to lingering after Grand Prix. Until the second
or third week in July one may see famous mondaines at
the restaurants, the theatres, and the open-air clubs,
which are a recent Parisian fad, may pass them driving
in the Bois, or notice their equipages drawn up before
the shops of the Rue de la Paix or the dressmaking
palaces of the Place Vendôme. After that time, however,
though to the casual visitor Paris may seem as animated
and as crowded as ever, he who knows la Ville Lumière
realizes that for the moment it is a social desert. The
smart world is out round the Normandy circuit in the
wake of the horses, is flirting and lounging and frivolling
in seashore villas and casinos, is taking the baths and
playing high at popular spas, or is motoring frantically
over the face of Europe, with intervals for all of these
occupations. It is the most restless class in the world, this
Parisian smart set,&mdash;a class curiously compact of nerves
and intellect, though the intellect is perhaps oddly
applied to the purposes of life; and though a wealth of
poetical similes has first and last been applied to la belle
Parisienne, the one truthful if not poetic which would
suit her best is the human peg-top. It spins to brave
music, this peg-top, but its metier is to spin.</p>

<p>Fifi and the Duchess take leave of the horses on the
day of the Grand Prix, but they are on hand to cheer
them at Caen, and the Normandy racing circuit is, in
its way, quite as gay, quite as popular, as the racing
season in Paris. The greater part of the fashionable
Parisian world is in Normandy for the summer season
and within easy motoring distance of all of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
races. Those who are not so located come from wherever
they may be summering to attend the opening of
the circuit at Caen or the "grande semaine" at Deauville,
Trouville. A multitude of humbler Parisians is
also having its summer outing on the Normandy coast,
and is quite as much devoted to racing as its social
betters. And then Paris itself is but a few hours away,
a short journey whether by train or motor, and folk city-bound
may run up to the coast for the great racing days.</p>

<p>So history repeats itself at Caen, at Houlgate, at
Deauville, at Dieppe, at Ostend. It is the old story of
Auteuil and Longchamps over again, with a different setting;&mdash;the
same horses, the same owners, the same
jockeys, the same onlookers. Only the women's frocks
are new and Paris is hours away, while white sands and
blue sea are close at hand. There is a short fall racing
season round about Paris, crowded in twixt summer outings
and the time of dog and gun. Then Fifi and the
Duchess tuck their betting books away until after the
Riviera season. Perhaps they foot up their gains and
losses. Much more probably they do nothing of the
kind. Why bother with what Mr. Mantalini would call
"the demn'd total." The races have served their purpose.
They have furnished amusement and excitement,
have fed the avid nerves. One has danced and has paid
the piper&mdash;or has persuaded someone else to pay him.
Now one must give one's mind to toilettes for the
Riviera. The racing season is past, and with the Parisienne
the past&mdash;be it but the yesterday&mdash;is buried
deep.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">LE SPORT IN PARIS</p>

<p class="pn p2">Parisian society is not given over wholly to racing
during those weeks that lie between the March winds
and braziers of Auteuil and the sunshine and flowers of
Grand Prix. Smart social functions of all kinds are
packed closely into the sunshiny days and the balmy
nights, and the daytime reunions have increased and
multiplied during recent years; for the Parisienne has
taken up "le sport."</p>

<p>It is a tyrant, le sport. It exacts the surrender of
many of the self-indulgent habits of Madame. It demands
of her more violent exercise than is agreeable to
the true Frenchwoman; it forces her into short frocks
for which she has no love; it endangers her carefully
protected complexion; it interferes with her siesta; it
even gets her up early in the morning after a night of
dancing and merry-making&mdash;but it is chic, <i>tr-r-r-ès</i>
chic, le sport, and so the Parisienne accepts it with the
verve which characterizes all she does.</p>

<p>The English and Americans are responsible for the
rise of sports in Paris, and neither Frenchmen nor Frenchwomen
will ever, as a class, go in for tennis, golf, hockey,
polo, etc., with the genuine energy and enjoyment displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
by their transatlantic and trans-channel cousins;
but they go through the motions and they have the most
ornate and attractive of installations for each separate
sport, and there is a small French element which actually
distinguishes itself in outdoor athletics. The English
and American residents in Paris do the rest, and so le
sport flourishes mightily round about the city on the
Seine.</p>

<p>To certain forms of sport, the Parisian takes as naturally
as does a duck to water. He loves excitement,
danger, swift motion. He will take, with a reckless
audacity, sporting risks at which an Englishman or
American might hesitate; but ask him to work hard at
a game, to lame his muscles and blister his feet and
hands, and earn his golf score or tennis score or hockey
score by the sweat of his brow, and, as a rule, he will beg
to be excused. What is true of the Parisian is true of
the Parisienne. Both combine a certain sensuous indolence
of body with a wild energy of nerves and brain.
They do not like exercise, but they adore excitement;
and it is only in the sports that cater to their nervous
excitability that they excel.</p>

<p>The automobile whirled its way straight into the hearts
of the French. From the first it was extravagantly
popular in Paris. Here was a sport that suited perfectly
the French temperament. There was danger in it, excitement
in it, piquancy in it. It afforded exhilaration.
It provided the swift changes and sudden contrasts so
dear to the restless and dramatic temperament. With
an automobile as slave of the lamp, one could range far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
afield even in one short day, and the possibilities held
in solution within the twenty-four hours were multiplied
astonishingly when the motor made its début in Parisian
society. Small wonder that it was greeted with acclaim.</p>

<p>One might fancy that the difficulty of looking well in
motor costume would prejudice the Parisienne against
the machine, for with her, the most important thing
connected with taking up a new sport is the excuse
offered for a new and piquant costume. But the difficulties
in the way of the motor woman merely added
zest to the adoption of the fad.</p>

<p>Madame flew to her dressmaker.</p>

<p>"Tiens, M'sieu. I have bought three automobiles.
What shall I wear?"</p>

<p>And Monsieur brought his brows together in his most
effective and judicial fashion, led the fair motor woman
to an inner room where the conference might have the
quiet demanded by such weighty consultations, and set
himself to planning methods of leaping this sartorial
hurdle.</p>

<p>Some of the experimental stages of the Parisian motor
costume were fearful and wonderful, and even now
our importers bring over spectacular motor outfits to
which are attached the names of famous makers; but,
on the whole, the Parisienne has mastered the problem
of motor dress.</p>

<p>For her electric brougham and victoria and the other
luxurious, smooth-running electric vehicles in which she
speeds over the asphalt and takes her afternoon outing
in the Bois, no special costume is required. Perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
if she is her own chauffeuse, she wears a trim tailor
frock and hat, but no eccentricity enters into her attire
even then, and, as a rule, she wears what she might wear
were the carriage drawn by horses instead of being
propelled by electricity.</p>

<p>If she is going farther afield&mdash;out to the Henri Quatre
for luncheon, to the Reservoir for dinner&mdash;she wears an
all-enveloping dust cloak to protect her delicate frock,
a veil or perhaps a hood to cover her fragile hat and
shield her face and hair from dust, but beneath this
outer wrapping she is as exquisite, as elaborate as ever.
When it comes to longer runs, or to genuine touring, the
Parisienne promptly abandons all effort to look well on
the road. To be comfortable, to be suitably dressed,
to be immaculate at the journey's end,&mdash;all these aims
demand the setting aside of a desire to be beautiful; and,
since she may not be beautiful, the quick-witted Madame
seizes upon the possibility of being piquant and goes to
the extreme of attaining the hideous in pursuit of the
practical. She hides figure, hair, face. Even her sparkling
eyes are eclipsed behind goggles or dimmed by
masks, and she consoles herself for the ugliness by
thought of the dramatic effect with which she may
flutter from the cocoon when her butterfly moment
arrives.</p>

<p>One sees these transformations by the score at such a
rendezvous as Chantilly at the time of the "Derby," for
it is the mode to motor to Chantilly on the eve of the
important day and put up over night at the Grand
Condé, or to arrive in time for luncheon before the races.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Machine after machine dashes up to the hotel, discharges
its freight of grotesque figures and wheezes away to the
garage. Madame, carrying a hat box, and cloaked,
hooded, masked, powdered with dust, hurries to the
chamber reserved for her. In a twinkling there trips
from the room which swallowed the awesome enigma
a charming woman, fresh, dainty, smiling, gowned in
the airiest and most delicate of confections. Or perhaps
there is not even the moment of seclusion. A toot, a
whir, a quick reversing of levers! The automobile has
stopped. A dusty, shrouded, shapeless figure springs
lightly to the step, while the idlers look on curiously.
A swift movement of the hands and the hood falls back;
another, and the cloak slips from the shoulders. There
is Fifi, a Dresden china figure all fluttering frills and laces
and ribbon and flowers, a smile on her lips, a challenge
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"C'est chic, ça," comments the old Marquis over his
Burgundy. "All that there is of the most modern, mon
garçon!"</p>

<p>Paris is the city of automobiles, and France is the
motor tourist's paradise. The roads are good, the inns
are excellent and are rapidly improving under the influence
of the motor touring, and on every hand are
picturesque towns and picturesque scenery, not too rugged
for the peace of mind of the average chauffeur.</p>

<p>Many inns known to history, but fallen from their
high estate in later years, are looking up again since the
motor took the road. At any hour, a gay crowd of folk,
masquerading in dust coats and goggles and hoods, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
appear at the door demanding luncheon or dinner.
They know a good wine and a good sauce, these travellers,
and they scatter gold in a fashion that recalls stories of
the days when the great men of old France and their
retinues took their ease in this same inn. Mine host's
heart warms to the devil wagon and its Parisian freight.
He brings long hoarded bottles covered with cobwebs
up from the cellars, he sacrifices his choicest chickens,
he goes into the kitchen himself to prepare the fish and
the sauces, he scolds his wife and bullies the cook and
embraces the maid, all from pure excitement, and beams
upon the world in general and the motorists in particular;
for he sees the dawn of a new day and hears the clink of
coin in his long empty tills.</p>

<p>He gives to the party of his best; and, when they
whirl away, he stands at his door watching the cloud of
dust that envelopes them. Then he draws a long breath,
sniffs ecstatically at the gasoline-laden air.</p>

<p>"Que j'aime cette odeur là!" he says with fervour.
The automobile has an ardent friend in mine host of
the country inn.</p>

<p>With the restaurant keeper at Paris, the story is a
different one. It is so easy to run away from the city
for luncheon or dinner since the motor car is at one's
service, and the wandering has an effect upon the receipts
in the town restaurant. Moreover,&mdash;one smiles
at this, but it is told in all seriousness and with lively grief
by the proprietors of certain cafés, and echoed dolefully
by women accustomed to late suppers and carousals in
those rendezvous,&mdash;the automobile has been a reforming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
agent. It has interfered with the long established habits
of the gilded youth and more heavily gilded age, wont to
furnish the late suppers and the wherewithal for carousal.</p>

<p>"It makes a difference, the automobile, a great difference,"
confides the discreet waiter. "Monsieur now
rises early. Before, he was up early, also, but with a
difference. Now he is to make a day's run in his
car. The programme requires that he shall start with
the sunrise. It demands steady nerves, the automobiling.
One needs sleep,&mdash;and Monsieur goes to bed
early. <i>Oui, c'est dommage.</i> <i>Ça dérange les choses</i>, but
he will not stay. No; he is devoted to the automobile.
He will even sleep for it. It will pass, perhaps, this
mania. They pass always, the manias. Then again
we will have the old crowd, and in the meantime there
are, fortunately, those who do not own the machines."</p>

<p class="b1">Of places furnishing the motive for short automobile
trips from Paris there is no end, and the roads running
out of the city swarm with cars. There are quiet-loving
country folk who protest, futilely, but even the country
horse and the excitable barnyard fowl of France have
become accustomed to the snort of the motor and the
onward rush of the demon, and are, like Pet Marjorie's
turkey, "more than usual calm" as the great machine
speeds past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">One meets them everywhere, these automobiles. Out
in the Forest of Fontainebleau the mosses are still green
and gold where the sunshine filters to them through the
interlacing branches of the great trees. The rocks are
still covered with grey and green and faint purple
lichens. Little wood creatures rustle among the ferns
and heather. Bird-notes sound from the branches overhead
and from the thicket depths. The forest is still
the grey-green, gold-green, brown and violet forest
beloved of French artists, but one cannot walk for ten
minutes along the woodland paths without hearing the
blast of a Gabriel horn and seeing a huge automobile
plunge by, its occupants blind to the light and shadow
and colour, deaf to the rustle in the brake and the music
from the bough, absorbed simply and solely in the
breathless speed of their pace and in the skill with which
the chauffeur swings round corners, dodges boulders,
and avoids climbing trees, for to the motor maniac,
Fontainebleau means the Hôtel d'Angleterre and luncheon.
To the impotent rage of the artist clan, the motor
has invaded Barbizon as well, and is to be found by
the dozen, puffing and panting outside the inn sacred
to the Bohemians of the Latin Quarter and Montmartre.
"C'est très gentil, Barbizon&mdash;très chic," says
Madame with an approving nod of her hooded head,
as she climbs into the auto, after her luncheon. Shades
of Millet and Corot and Rousseau! Barbizon has lived
to be called "très chic" by a Parisian Duchess in
a blue silk hood.</p>

<p>Wherever historic memories and associations cluster
most thickly, where ghosts walk in the greatest numbers,
there the automobile roars and rattles and toots and
puffs its consummately modern way. Many Parisians
are for the first time discovering France since motor
touring came into vogue. Even Fifi talks French history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and folk-lore. She has invoked the sunken city of Y's
as she sped through Brittany in her Panhard. She has
a speaking acquaintance with all Normandy. She has
motored down through old Provence on her gay way to
Monte Carlo. If she remembers stopping places rather
by what she had to eat there than by historic associations&mdash;still
she has enlarged her horizon. Even gastronomic
voyaging is educational.</p>

<p>Close to Paris there are popular restaurants, within
driving distance and almost too near at hand to please
those who seek luncheon or dinner in motor cars. The
Henri Quatre at St. Germain is frequented more than
ever by Parisian diners, since motoring eliminated distance.
The Reservoir at Versailles, the Bellevue at
Meudon, the Cadran Bleu at St. Cloud&mdash;all have their
motoring contingents, and at luncheon and dinner hours
there is a host of machines waiting before these country
restaurants, where one may have the luxury of Paris
and the beauty and seclusion of nature, provided one
has the money to pay for the abnormal combination&mdash;which
comes high.</p>

<p>One goes to the golf links, too, in one's automobile,
unless one prefers driving out&mdash;for the motor has not
yet entirely undermined the Parisian's love for a smart
trap and good pair of horses.</p>

<p>There are various links near Paris, all more or less
frequented by devotees of le sport, but the links at
La Boulié, near Versailles, are, with the exception of
those at Deauville, the finest in France. All the smart
set of Paris goes to la Boulié to flirt, to gossip, to drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and smoke and play cards and meet friends. Incidentally
golf is played, and real golfers, enjoying the
beautiful course and the perfect greens, bless the day
when golf became a Parisian fad, and look tolerantly at
the goodly collection of dukes and counts and princes and
bankers and diplomats who sit in the shade of the big bungalow
during the long golden afternoon, drinking Scotch
whiskey and soda,&mdash;as a concession to the genius loci,&mdash;and
watching with a certain amused wonder the scattered
figures toiling around the links in the glare of the sun.</p>

<p>"After all, they stood for the thing," says Willy, as he
picks his ball out of the last hole and turns toward the
indolent groups around the club-house.</p>

<p>That is just it. They stood for it all; and if a majority
of the men do not play&mdash;well, tastes differ. It is a
charming place to "five-o'clocker," is la Boulié.</p>

<p>The Parisienne and her admirers admit that, from one
point of view, golf has profound merit. As an excuse
for a prolonged promenade à deux it is admirable and
"le flirt" thrives famously on the links. One is willing
to make sacrifices in the interests of flirtation; but that
one should golf for the love of golfing, should play from
sun up to sun down alone or with another man,&mdash;"Ça,
c'est trop," says Monsieur with a shrug of his shapely
shoulders, and, having imbibed whiskey and soda for
the sake of the golfing unities, he orders a vermouth by
way of relaxation. Even assisting at le sport is exacting,
very exacting. One becomes fatigued.</p>

<p>And yet there are Frenchmen who love the game and
play it well, and if one covets the privilege of familiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
shouting "fore" at a Russian Grand Duke, or an Italian
Prince, or an Austrian Baron, la Boulié is the place in
which to gratify that heart's desire. The visitor to
Paris may have the entrée to the club by virtue of one
dollar a day and introductions from two of the club
members; but though the dollar may be procurable, the
casual tourist is not likely to enjoy the acquaintance of
two members of the la Boulié set, and the chances are
that he does his Parisian golfing at l'Hermitage, where
any respectable introduction is an open sesame.</p>

<p>Some of the smartest of Parisiennes have gone in for
golf and play fairly well, but they golf in costumes that
would fill the Scotch and English lassies of the famous
scores with frank amazement.</p>

<p>"You have seen Lady L&mdash;&mdash;," whispers Madame of
the Rue de la Paix golfing costume. "She is English,
yes. It is wonderful how she plays golf&mdash;and without
a corset! But yes, vraiment, quite without a corset.
C'est incroyable ça. One has the lines of a poplar."</p>

<p>It all depends upon the point of view. One sacrifices
one's game or one's curves. Either way, the choice has
its compensations.</p>

<p>L'Hermitage is not so chic as la Boulié, but there are
true golfers, even among the social elect, who enjoy
playing on the Hermitage links and like the democratic
geniality of the less exclusive club; so the membership
list has its sprinkling of notable names.</p>

<p>The course lies out near St. Germain, on the old farm
of M. Jean Boussod, and neither the links nor the house
will compare with la Boulié in point of art and costliness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
but there is a charm in the cluster of old-fashioned
cottages over which the vines and roses clamber, in the
raftered dining-room, in the old fruit trees under which
tea is served, in the stately poplars which stand sentinel
over the place, and in the informality which makes even
the tourist stranger feel less far from Ardsley and
Baltusrol.</p>

<p>There are good links at Compiègne, too, but Compiègne
is too far from Paris for the ordinary golfer,
unless he is going away for a week-end of the sport, and
only in hot weather do the Parisians stray so far from
the boulevards in pursuit of the royal game.</p>

<p>For tennis, the Parisienne has more love than for golf.
The game is an older friend, and then, though it does
not furnish, as does golf, ample pretext for prolonged
solitude à deux, it does have a dramatic quality, a
certain swift dash and spirit which appeal to Madame's
temperament and are lacking in the more protracted
and leisurely game. There are good tennis courts at
the golf clubs and in various parts of the Bois, but it is
at the Cercle de l'Ile de Puteaux that one finds tennis at
its best and most picturesque. It is one of the most
fashionable and most exclusive clubs of Paris, this club
on the little island of Puteaux, in the Seine. One sees
there no one who is not of the elect, and the little ferry
that carries the chosen spirits to these Elysian fields is
thronged with the beauty and fashion of Paris, day after
day, during the season. Such a gay freight the little
ferry carries when Puteaux is especially en fête, such
charming women, such ravishing gowns, such bewitching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
hats, such coquettish parasols, such admiring cavaliers!
A veritable "embarquement pour Cythère!" The ferry
should be guided by flutterings loves, à la Fragonard,
instead of by the most prosaic Charon who fills the position
and regards, unmoved, the carnival of the vanities.</p>

<p>They play tennis at Puteaux, but they play at the
making of love and of epigrams and of fashion more
earnestly still. One may see all the fashion leaders of
the beau monde drinking tea there on a bright spring
afternoon,&mdash;the lovable young Duchesse d'Uzes, with
her excessive modernity grafted upon her ancient lineage
and traditions; the beautiful Madame Letellier, who is
one of the best dressed women of Paris; the blonde and
chic Vicomtesse Foy, the popular Mrs. Ridgway, the
wealthy Baronne Henri de Rothschild, Baronne Seillière.
These are some of the women who set the fashions, but
the complete list is a long one, and Puteaux brings
together all these orchids of Paris.</p>

<p class="b1">There have been memorable evening fêtes at Puteaux
when the island was converted into a fairyland of
gleaming lights and mysterious shadows of flowers and
music, and all that modern luxury which is pagan in its
prodigality; and cotillions are given there regularly
during a part of the season. But the island is at its best
when the sun is shining on it and touching to vividness
the pretty frocks of the tennis players in the courts,
when vivacious women in wonderful gowns and hats are
gossiping over their tea in the shade or flirting under
their parasols of chiffon and lace. It belongs to the
open-air phase of French society, does Puteaux, for,
oddly enough, the Parisienne of the scented boudoir and
the hot-house associations has a passion for plein air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Out in the Bois there are open-air clubs and to spare,
the Polo Club and the Tir au Pigeon being those most
frequented by the fashionable set during spring and
summer, while the club des Patineurs is the smart
skating club and one of the most attractive social rendezvous
of winter Paris. The Parisienne loves skating.
Here is a sport that lends itself amiably to coquetry, a
sport for which one may plan the most piquant of costumes.
Furs are becoming and extravagant, and looking
well at an extravagant cost is the fashionable Parisienne's
chief aim in life. So Madame orders her skating costumes
of fur and cloth and velvet, buys an assortment
of skating boas more ornamental than practical, and
plays in her skating as in all her sports a rôle vastly
ornamental, impressively dramatic. Yachting, too, is
dear to the heart of our Lady of the Chiffons, though her
yachting consists chiefly in dressing the part. Scoffers
say that the French have a flourishing yacht club but no
yachts, and while this statement is more amusing than
accurate, the actual facts do suggest some such comic-opera
situation, for though there is a yacht club of
France, extremely swell and of large membership, and
though several wealthy Frenchmen own superb yachts,
there is little serious French yachting. Boating of one
sort or another is indulged in along the Seine, and a large
flotilla of small private launches and yachts lies in the
basin of Deauville during the Normandy season, but the
yachting races of the Regatta week at Havre are given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
over almost wholly to foreigners, French entries being
extremely rare.</p>

<p>Not until within the past year did the fashionable folk
of Paris take up with ardour any form of water sport.
The motor boat has brought about the revolution and
has the distinction of being the latest Parisian fad. It
is easy to understand why this most modern form of
boating has caught the Parisian fancy. Like the automobile,
it appeals irresistibly to the French temperament.
It demands no active exercise and it offers exhilaration,
swift travel, danger, novelty. Last summer there was
a race for motor boats from Paris to the sea; and, while
the little boats were scudding along the river, the society
folk interested in them were spinning along the road
from Paris to Trouville in their automobiles, making
calls at the châteaux en route, and reaching Trouville-Deauville,
in time to see the up-to-date little boats follow
up their three days' race to Havre by racing for the
Menier cup in Trouville Bay. The motor boat came into
its own that day, and next summer it will rival the horse
and the automobile in the affections of sporting Paris.</p>

<p>Already a number of Parisiennes have adopted the
dangerous playthings. Madame du Gast, upon whom
some judges bestow the title of "first sportswoman of
France," is an ardent devotee of motor boating as she
has been of automobiling. She has all the daring of her
race associated with an easy nonchalance and imperturbable
self-control which never deserts her even under
the most trying circumstances; and no pastime is too
dangerous, no risk too hazardous for her, provided only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that there is amusement connected with the danger and
hazard. She has made a record in automobile races
and ballooning, and she hailed the motor boat with joy
at its first appearance; but her sporting enthusiasm had
of course its Parisian side. There was the costume to
be considered&mdash;always the costume is the starting-point
of a Parisienne's sport. The motor boat is a treacherous
plaything. It upsets, blows up, sinks,&mdash;and
when one starts out in a promenade à bateau, one is
likely to swim home, so petticoats and chiffons are not
for motor boating. Madame du Gast wears what looks
much like swimming tights, save that the one-piece
garment is high of neck, long of sleeve, and at the knee
tucks into trim high boots that may be kicked off if
occasion demands. Over this practical attire goes a
loose, handsome coat of sporting allure which quite hides
the tights and falls over the tops of the well-fitted boots;
a becoming cap warranted to stay on without attention
from its wearer&mdash;and there you have the owner of the
Camille as she looks when she enters a race. When she
had the Turquoise built for the Monaco races, Madame
du Gast indulged in a bit of drama characteristically
French. S. A. R. the Prince of Monaco stood sponsor
for the slim little craft. There was a ceremony, with
great sheaves of flowers nodding over the bow of the
boat and bedewed with the christening champagne, with
gaily attired friends looking on, and with the canon
from a neighbouring church in gorgeous vestments
solemnly bestowing baptism and the blessing of the
church upon the nautical infant. Roses and champagne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and smart frocks, and the owner of Monte Carlo, and
the church&mdash;all joining in the launching of the racing
boat of a charming sportswoman in swimming tights
and top boots! There you have a snapshot of le sport
as it is sometimes played in France.</p>

<p>The Camille, named for Madame du Gast herself,
and a motor boat more pretentious than the Turquoise,
entered, with owner aboard, the famous and foolhardy
high seas race from Tangiers to Toulon, and though
strong winds and rough seas played havoc with all of
the tiny craft, and the Camille and her owner were rescued
at the eleventh hour by her escorting yacht, Madame
did not lose for a moment her sporting nerve. She was
obtaining excitement in large blocks and the thrill was
well worth the danger.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the young Duchesse
d'Uzes has taken up motor boating.</p>

<p>When has she ever passed by a new sport, a new
chance for diversion, this gay little Duchess, who is the
typical fine flower of modern French civilization, the
most piquant and perhaps the most popular figure in
French society to-day.</p>

<p>She was born to social eminence, daughter of the great
and ancient family of de Luynes, sister of the ninth Duke
of Chaulnes and Pecquinguy, rich in her own name,
good to look at, keen of wit, exquisite of taste, and
stranger to fear. As if this were not enough, she must
needs marry Louis Emmanuel, fourteenth Duke d'Uzes,
and add his prestige and wealth to hers.</p>

<p>The dowager Duchesse d'Uzes, she who came so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
near mounting Boulanger on the back of France, is of the
old régime, strong, keen, autocratic still, but surrounding
herself with the old customs, the old traditions, refusing
to admit that the world has moved and France with it.</p>

<p>But the young Duchess&mdash;she is all that there is of
the most modern, the most representative type of the
motoring, racing, golfing, hunting, hockey-playing Parisienne.
She is all restlessness, all nerves. There is
nothing new that she has not tried, and she is always
reaching out for something more novel, more exciting,
more audacious. And yet with it all she is grande dame,
the little pleasure-seeking Duchess, and she wears her
title right royally in spite of her vagaries. She has the
traditions of her race, too, behind her modern caprices.
She is devôte, has her private chaplain, is heart and
soul in sympathy with the church party as opposed to
state, she loves politics and ranges herself with her class.
Not for nothing is one of de Luynes and d'Uzes. She
was in the heart of the turmoil on the Place de la Concorde,
at the meeting of protest against the state's
measures concerning the nuns, and she was taken by
the troops, this hot-headed little Duchess, though it was
the dowager Duchess who was arrested and fined. She
would go to the scaffold humming a tune and wearing
her smartest Paquin frock, were she called upon to
tread the path many of her ancestors trod, but, since
scaffolds are out of date, she runs a motor boat and
speeds an automobile, and dances a cake walk, and
plays an extraordinary game of billiards, and is one of
the best shots in France, and plays tennis and hockey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
and golf, and rides cross country, and swims like a fish,
and has made ballooning the fashion. She is one of the
prettiest, the most amusing, the cleverest and the best
dressed women of Paris, and she, beyond all of her set, is
the champion of le sport.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE FINE ART OF DINING</p>

<p class="pn p2">Paris is full of restaurants, but the list of those at
which one may enjoy both a supremely chic fashion
exhibit and a dinner worthy to be associated with the
clothes are comparatively few. Indeed, where the
frocks are up to an epicurean standard the food is sometimes
far below, and there are cafés in Paris where a
gourmet will find possibilities of ecstatic moments, but
where no swish of petticoats will break in upon his rapt
silences.</p>

<p>Not that the average viveur of Paris objects to association
of pâté and petticoat. Far from it. He will
follow the petticoat even to the Ritz where the pâté is
fairly sure to be poor,&mdash;but he will occupy his leisure
intervals by enjoying a meal at the Café Voisin, or
testing the famous cellars at the Café Anglais.</p>

<p>As for Madame,&mdash;she is a bit of a gourmande, of
course. One does not live in Paris for years without
learning the proper attitude toward a dinner, and the
Parisienne thinks more about her food than is consistent
with traditions of the fragile and ethereal feminine.
When a poetic vision in vaporous mousseline and lace
knits her beautiful brows and pouts her curving lips
and waxes vastly indignant because an entrée has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the right flavour or because a wine is not of the vintage
indicated by the label on the bottle, there is an uneasy
stirring in the mental pigeonhole where the observer
keeps his illusions; but, after all, the Parisienne, though
knowing in matters gastronomic, does not allow that
knowledge to destroy her sense of proportion. She
may like a good sauce and a good wine, but she insists
first of all that a dinner shall be well seasoned with
gaiety. She wants to dine where she may wear her
smartest frock and see the smartest frock of her dearest
foe, where she may see and be seen. She is coquette
before she is gourmande, and the restaurants where
she can combine both rôles are those to which she
accords most enthusiastic favour.</p>

<p class="b1">Go out to the Bois on a fine night in June, if pâtés
and petticoats divide your allegiance, and eat your
dinner in the courtyard of the Château de Madrid or
on the terrace at Armenonville. If you are a stranger
in Paris the latter will probably be your choice. The
fame of Armenonville has travelled far, and it stands
for all that Paris means to the visitor who has gained
his knowledge of the sorceress city from reading and
hearsay. It is in the Bois, this famous restaurant
where all the mad, merry world of Europe has dined
at one time or another, and, though rivals have come
and gone, though restaurants more elaborate and cuisines
more perfect have wooed the luxury-loving crowd,
Armenonville has held its own, has kept its place as
the most brilliantly popular café of Paris&mdash;and the
most cosmopolitan.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center">The latest Plaything of the Duchesse d'Uzes</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Frankly speaking, the café retains its vogue by favour
of the demi-mondaine of Paris. Long ago she chose
Armenonville for her own, and she has remained loyal
to her choice. This is not saying that for the beau-monde
the restaurant is taboo. Everybody goes to
Armenonville, but there, as to no other café, flock the
high-class demi-mondaines with their elaborate toilettes,
their superb jewels, their consummately sensuous
allure; and, as always, in their wake comes a reckless,
prodigal crowd. Terrace, verandahs, and inner rooms
are thronged night after night, and the throng is the
incarnation of the spirit that has made Paris the hub
of the frivolous world, has drawn from all countries
folk devoted to the worship of the vanities, has stamped
the money-spending set of Paris as the most consistently
volatile, the most systematically extravagant class of
Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>The leisure class of France is unreservedly a leisure
class. The Frenchman of wealth, rank, and leisure
is likely to give himself up to what someone has called
"the science of not making a living." He does not
have the vast business interests that usually claim
the wealthy American, he does not go in for public life
as does the average Englishman of a corresponding
class; and, though exceptions to this rule are many,
the chances are that he concentrates his energies upon
amusing himself and assiduously cultivates every taste
that will open an avenue to pleasurable sensation.</p>

<p>He is, for instance, connoisseur of food and wine,
but he is epicure not glutton. Your true gourmet has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
with much effort and at considerable cost trained his
palate to an appreciation of subtle distinctions, of vague,
elusive flavours. Eating and drinking are serious matters
with him. He eats not to kill his appetite but to
tickle his senses, and he values his capacity for epicurean
joys too highly to endanger it by riotous indulgence.
The Parisian viveur devotes to his meals an extravagant
amount of consideration. They are to him sacred
rites, mystic, unfathomable to the uninitiated. The
dishes are planned and arranged with reference to their
relation to one another, are harmonized, blended, resolved
into wonderful, sense-satisfying gastronomic
chords. A succession of flavours leads subtly and
cumulatively to a gastronomic climax, drinks are not
absorbed with blithe impartiality, but run a faultless
scale of stimulation and form a fitting accompaniment
to the progressive harmony of the food.</p>

<p>It is with other pleasures as with eating and drinking.
The Parisian takes his gaiety with profound seriousness,
and the foreigner, as well as the Parisian, if he stays
long in Paris, adapts himself to the epicurean point
of view.</p>

<p>Out at Armenonville, one comes into an understanding
of that modern paganism which lies at the heart
of Vanity Fair, though the scene does not represent
the most subtly æsthetic expression of the cult, for the
place is overcrowded, and there is a hurrying and bustling
of waiters, the laughter is a trifle too loud, the
perfumes are a trifle too heavy, the jewels a trifle too
resplendent. There is a burning fever in the pulse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Armenonville, a strain of coarseness in the gaiety.
The Vanity worshippers go about their devotions with
finer art over among the great trees of the courtyard
of Madrid.</p>

<p>But Armenonville is&mdash;Armenonville. One must
take it as one finds it, and one is likely to find it amusing.</p>

<p>The flowers and napery and service of the little tables
on the terrace&mdash;more popular on a summer night than
the tables within doors&mdash;glow with a roseate bloom
under the shaded lights. Vivid ruby and topaz gleam
in the wine-glasses, the air is throbbing with the wild,
passionate music of the Tziganes. Men of all types
and from all quarters of the globe lean to look into the
eyes of women marvellously gowned, magnificently
jewelled, flushed under the influence of music and wine
and admiration and conscious power. Laughter, wit,
the tinkle of glasses, the hum of voices talking gossip
in all the languages of Europe, delicately cooked dishes,
rare wines, colour, perfume, melody,&mdash;everywhere an
appeal to the senses, an effort to meet the demands of
a class with tastes trained to appreciate the fine flower
of all things material, and with money to pay for the
gratification of its desires! Nothing in old Rome was
in spirit more essentially pagan and prodigal than this,
but latter-day civilization has brought its refinements.
The Roman orgy has been translated into polite French.</p>

<p>If one sits long enough at one of the terrace tables,
familiar faces are likely to float within one's range of
vision, for all the world pays tribute to Armenonville,
and public characters are many in the crowd. Opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
singers, theatrical folk, famous writers and painters,
professional beauties, diplomats,&mdash;all the celebrities
whose pictures are most often in the papers are among
the diners. Over there at the end table, Tod Sloan is
sitting opposite a radiant being in cerise and silver.
At the next table the Prime Minister of England is
dining with an American Duchess and her English
Duke. Beyond her Grace, little Polaire of "Claudine"
fame is keeping a tableful of men in a gale of laughter.
An American millionaire is host to a group of theatrical
folk of whom Maxine Elliott is bright particular star,
and close at hand the Newstraten, who owes her notoriety
to the favour of another millionaire, is vis-à-vis
to a well-known Russian nobleman. Réjane, the ever-youthful,
is exchanging good French for bad with an
English theatrical manager. Leopold, King of the
Belgians, boulevardier, dear friend of Parisian cocottes,
is in evidence. A Turkish pasha with several members
of his suite is back to back with the greatest brewer of
England. London's latest Maharajah is having a royal
occidental time in company with several pretty and titled
English women. Mrs. Clarence Mackay and several
other members of the New York smart set are among
the elaborately gowned diners&mdash;but Madame Stanley
and Margyl and the beautiful Cavalieri are gowned
as well and more bejewelled. The crowd is never the
same, yet always the same, and all through the year
the show goes on, though cold weather drives the diners
from the terrace to over-heated and over-lighted rooms.</p>

<p>Over at the Madrid, too, there is picturesque dining&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with a difference. The old château lies on the
edge of the Bois, an unimposing building promising
little, and, so far as the building itself is concerned,
fulfilling its promises. One does not go to the Madrid
in winter. The rooms are small and stuffy, and poorly
adapted to restaurant purposes, but during the season
of al fresco dining, the Madrid is all that there is of the
most modish, a gathering place for the most exclusive
society folk of Paris. One drives boldly up to the
château and into an archway that leads through the
building and brings one out upon the edge of a big
courtyard picturesquely set with fine old forest trees
under which men and women are dining at little tables.
Beyond the court are the stables and, though a high,
thick hedge intervenes, a muffled stamping of hoofs,
the jingle of silver chains, sometimes furnishes a subdued
accompaniment to the music of the Tziganes, an
element hardly discordant and suggesting vaguely
ideas of mettled horses, of luxurious carriages, of all
that goes to the self-indulgence of such diners as those
beneath the trees.</p>

<p>Things are more tranquil here than at Armenonville&mdash;gay,
sense-satisfying, artificial, wordly, but of a finer
flavour. Here one finds the most aristocratic of Parisian
mondaines, the clique of the Polo Club and la Boulié
and Puteaux. Many nationalities are represented
among the diners, but the French are in the majority
and the Parisienne of the best type may be found under
the great trees of Madrid. She may be no more perfectly
dressed, this mondaine, than her demi-mondaine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
sister of Armenonville. Their frocks and hats come from
the same makers, their jewels were bought at the same
shop on the Rue de la Paix, the grande dame of Madrid
has perhaps not so liberal a share of good looks as the
lionne of Armenonville, and may be made up quite as
conscientiously&mdash;for artificiality is beloved of the
Parisienne, is a part of her creed&mdash;but my lady of
Madrid has the something which sets her apart, the
impress of race, of blood, of class. Even the veriest
stranger within Parisian gates who might wander from
one café to the other would realize at first impression
that the two were separated by more than the green
stretches of the Bois. As to which café he would prefer,
that depends upon his tastes&mdash;and to some extent
upon his mood. One who does not "belong" at Madrid
may feel himself a lonely outsider. No one is on the
outside at Armenonville save the bankrupt.</p>

<p>There are other cafés in the Bois whose fortunes have
risen and fallen, but none rank with Armenonville and
Madrid, though quite recently the Café de Lac has taken
a fresh lease of life and begun to find favour with the
smart Parisian crowd.</p>

<p>Report has it, however, that there is to be a new
restaurant in the Bois, one that will totally eclipse the
two reigning cafés, and will set a new standard for
the world. A syndicate with unlimited capital has the
project in hand, and it is said that the new pleasure
palace will rise on the site of the old Pre Catalan,&mdash;Arcadian
little farm where a herd of mild-eyed cows
furnishes fresh milk for children, and a little café supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
drinks of less Arcadian simplicity to anyone who
asks for them. For years the popular duelling ground
of Paris was just behind the buildings of the Pre Catalan.
There is a little ruined theatre, too, behind
the restaurant, and all the smart world of Paris has
upon occasion gone out there to see the actors of the
Théâtre Français and the Odeon give classical plays
upon the sylvan stage. Such piquant incongruities
are dear to the French heart.</p>

<p>But it is in the middle of the afternoon that the Pre
Catalan is charming. Carriages full of children, with
their quaintly costumed bonnes or their fashionably
dressed mammas, roll up, one after another, and deposit
their loads, until the place is all abloom with babies
and musical with pattering feet and babbling tongues.
They have come to drink the fresh milk, these pretty,
overdressed children. Even the babies lead a life
chic, in Paris.</p>

<p>And when the babies are all snugly asleep in their
beds, the Pre Catalan often has other visitors. Late
diners who have made a night of it in town cafés, and
then driven about the Bois singing romantic ballads
and growing more maudlin moment by moment, drive
up to the Pre Catalan in the grey dawn, and weep upon
the shoulder of the waiter who brings them their glasses
of fresh milk. It is milk they want. They are in a
state of exuberant sentimentality&mdash;of dramatic remorse.
They have renounced Bacchus and all his
crew. They are beginning new lives. The world is
a weariness and a delusion, full of headaches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
profound melancholy&mdash;Fifi goes back to nature at the
Pre Catalan in such a mood,&mdash;but midnight finds her
at the Café de Paris once more.</p>

<p>It is in this place of duels and babies and tipsy penitents
that the new restaurant is to shine resplendent,
if plans do not miscarry. Whether with all its grandeurs
it will attract the crowd remains to be seen. A restaurant's
success is not always in proportion to the
money spent in equipping it. There, for example,
was the Café des Fleurs. It was the prettiest café in
Paris. The men behind it were so wealthy that they
did not care whether the place paid or not. They
lavished money upon the decorations, the cuisine, the
cellars. They hired the best Tzigane orchestra in Paris&mdash;and
the fashionable crowd stayed away. Why?
No one knows why. "The women would not come,"
says the promoter, with a shrug. "There is no accounting
for the whims of the women. There was everything
to attract them and they would not come,&mdash;c'était
finis."</p>

<p>Cafés by the score have had this same history, or have
had a brief brilliant success and a failure sudden and
complete. There was Cubats on the Champs Elysées,
superbly installed in a house where had lived the mistress
of Louis Napoleon. For a little while everyone
went to Cubats. The place had enormous success, and
then, all of a sudden, the crowd stopped going. Cubats
did not exist. Perhaps the diners grew tired of being
robbed. Parisians of the high-living class do not object
to spending money. It is their metier, but the prices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
at Cubats were monumental and the proprietor in other
and less humdrum times would have been a bold buccaneer
or a bandit chief. One night a diner ordered
a melon with his dinner. The waiter reported that
melons were out of season. The patron growled, the
waiter murmured that he would call Monsieur. Monsieur
came, bland, imperturbable, and listened to the
growling.</p>

<p>M'sieu wished absolutely to have a melon? But
certainly. One could get it. It would be for after
the dinner instead of before the dinner, however. That
would be satisfactory?</p>

<p>The diner, mollified, signified his willingness to eat
his melon after his sweet, and when the appointed time
arrived, the melon arrived with it. Later, the bill
arrived in its turn. One item read: "Melon&mdash;250
francs." There was a storm and the matter went to
the courts, but the restaurateur remained imperturbable.
The melon was expensive&mdash;he admitted as much to
the judge sorrowfully&mdash;but M'sieu would have it.
When one orders horses and carriage and sends a special
messenger post-haste through the night for many miles
in order to gratify a patron's whim, one must be paid
for one's trouble. The judge appreciated the point
and the bill was paid,&mdash;but in time Cubats closed its
doors.</p>

<p>Outside of Paris there are many restaurants to which
Parisians drive or motor for dinner when they are tired
of the Bois, yet want to escape from city walls. The
Reservoir at Versailles, and the Henri Quatre at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Germain, are the oldest, the most famous of the list,
and though for a time their prestige declined in so far
as the truly fashionable diners were concerned, both
have taken on new popularity since the automobile
brought about a mania for dining out of town. At the
Reservoir one is in the midst of historic associations.
The place, with its decorations and furnishings in
pure Louis XVI style, was already famous when Marie
Antoinette played at farming in the Petit Trianon, near
by. The place has seen many notable dinners,
harboured many illustrious personages, and its ancient
grandeur clings about it like a garment, though it caters
now to the most mixed and modern of fashionable
crowds.</p>

<p>Historic memories swarm thickly about the Henri
Quatre too. Louis the XIV was born in the building
which is now a restaurant, and a cradle marks the café
silver. From the terrace and the windows one looks
over miles of fertile valley, and at the tables one finds,
save upon Sunday, a particularly chic crowd. On
Sunday the bourgeoisie invade the place, but during the
week it is very much the thing to run out to the Henri
Quatre for luncheon or dinner.</p>

<p>It is a pity le Roi galant cannot come back to his
own for at least one summer night. He had ever an
eye for a pretty woman, and it would warm even his
ghost to watch the women who flutter from automobile
or carriage to the pavilion that bears his name. He
would smile approval too at the woman of the golf or
tennis costume, for this hot-headed Henry was catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
in his tastes. Perhaps it is the tolerance of his spirit
that has made possible at the Henri Quatre what would
be shocking at the Bellevue, where the Pompadour is
presiding genius. La Grande Marquise was not a
marvel of morality, but upon etiquette she stood firm.
One must be in grande toilette for Bellevue, but for the
Henri Quatre&mdash;that is as one chooses.</p>

<p>Pretty women in ravishing toilettes flock to the tables
of the glass-enclosed verandahs; but, side by side with
the woman of the trailing chiffon and lace, of the wonderful
driving cloak, of the picture hat, is the woman
who has been playing golf or tennis at some one of the
clubs round about St. Germain. The chances are that,
being French, she has not played violently enough to
disarrange her costume. It is as immaculate, as perfect
in its way as the dinner toilette of the woman who has
driven out from town, but she adores le sport, and she
chatters about it enthusiastically over her truffles and
champagne, looking, the while, like a Dresden china
image of a golf girl.</p>

<p>High above the bank of the Seine at Meudon stands
the Bellevue, a restaurant de luxe, which was built only
a few years ago, and has had a considerable vogue, but
has suffered since the day of the automobile arrived,
because it is hardly far enough from Paris to afford a
good motor spin, though too far to be as convenient as
the restaurants of the Bois.</p>

<p>The Pompadour once had a villa where the picturesque
white building now stands far above the river and overlooking
all the country round, and in point of elegance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the modern belles who dine on the terrace or in the
white arched dining-rooms live up to the traditions of
the place where the Grande Marquise held butterfly
court; for one dons one's smartest frock for Bellevue.
From the river a funicular leads up to the broad
terraces in front of the Pavilion. Behind the restaurant
the wooded hill climbs on up toward the sky,
and on its top Flammarion's observatory is perched.
There is a little hotel in the woods, an unimportant
place, where Bellevue parties may stay over night if
they do not care to go back to the city after a late dinner
or supper,&mdash;and it is not always easy to get back to
town if one has come out to Bellevue in plebeian fashion
by train or boat, and lingered late in defiance of boat
and railway time-tables. A party of Americans were
stranded that way one night last summer. No train,
no boat,&mdash;and no knowledge of the little hotel in the
woods. No carriage to be had, unless les messieurs
could wait indefinitely. Les messieurs, being New
Yorkers, were not fond of waiting. They tucked the mesdames
under their arms, and went out to reconnoitre.
In the court stood a magnificent big touring-car, in
charge of a liveried and stately chauffeur. One of the
Americans boldly approached the imposing personage.</p>

<p>"My man," he said in French that was intelligible if
scarcely academic, "I want you to take us into town."</p>

<p>The Frenchman stared in amazement.</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur, this is a private automobile. M.
le baron is having supper in there with&mdash;eh bien, with
a lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Exactly," said the man from New York. "But
you are going to take us to town. The baron will never
know you're gone. I saw the lady."</p>

<p>The chauffeur lapsed into what Mark Twain would
call "a profound French calm." He wrung his hands
and rolled his eyes and shrugged his shoulders and
called the gods to witness that the baron would eat him
alive if he dared to consider such a proposition.</p>

<p>The man from New York listened with interest; and,
when the conversationalist paused for breath, ran his
hand into his pocket and brought forth something that
clinked musically.</p>

<p>"It's worth one hundred francs to me to go to town
in the baron's car," he said.</p>

<p>The chauffeur looked at the open hand, at the car,
at the restaurant door. His conscience struggled within
him and was silenced.</p>

<p>"Voyons, M'sieu, we will consider." He tiptoed to
a window, looked into the dining-room, and returned
with the air of a comic opera conspirator.</p>

<p>"C'est bien, M'sieu. They arrive at the salad.
There is always the dessert, the coffee, the cigar, the
liqueur. One can do it, but it is to be hoped that M'sieu
and his friends do not object to speed."</p>

<p>That was a wild ride to Paris,&mdash;up hill and down, at
top speed, with never a slackening for corners or for foot
passengers. The Americans were dropped where they
could take cabs and the hundred francs changed hands.</p>

<p>"Much obliged. Good luck to you," said the man
from New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The chauffeur consulted his watch. "Provided
always that they have not quarrelled," he murmured
anxiously&mdash;and the machine shot away into the night.</p>

<p>Down in the heart of Paris, the Café de Paris, the
Café Paillard, and the Ritz are the restaurants in which
one may best study purple and fine linen. There are
other cafés famed for cuisine and cellars, but my Lady
of the Chiffons finds them dull, and in the creed of a
Parisienne dulness heads the list of mortal sins.</p>

<p>Americans and English are the mainstay of the Ritz,
save during the tea hour, when the crowd becomes
cosmopolitan. At the Café Paillard one finds the diners
of the Madrid a clique aristocratic, mondain, and chiefly
French. The Café de Paris repeats the story of Armenonville,
though without the picturesque woodland
setting and the attractive al fresco features. The two
cafés have the same clientèle, the same atmosphere,&mdash;even
the same proprietor. He is a subject for congratulation,
this proprietor. The famous old Café
Foyot, under the shadow of the Luxembourg, is his
too, and the Café de Paris of Trouville, and the Helder
at Nice,&mdash;all, save the Foyot, tremendously popular
with the crowd vowed to extravagance and folly, and,
as a result of that popularity, all phenomenally successful
from a financial point of view. The Foyot also has
a success, but of a different kind.</p>

<p>Naturally, the man who manages these restaurants
is rich. His private establishments are handsome, he
spends money lavishly, but&mdash;and here is the secret of
his success&mdash;he is first of all a restaurateur, eternally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
vigilant, neglecting no detail, proud of his metier, glorying
in his triumphs. He could buy, twice over, many
of his patrons, yet one will see him moving about among
his hurrying waiters, suggesting, prompting, reprimanding,
seeing all things, adjusting all difficulties, pouring
oil on all troubled waters.</p>

<p>He stops for a moment beside an old patron.</p>

<p>"Ah, Comte X&mdash;&mdash;, bon soir."</p>

<p>His eyes rest upon the fish that has been placed before
the count, and his face clouds. A motion of his hand
brings an alarmed waiter.</p>

<p>"You serve the sole so, to Monsieur le Comte? You
think perhaps that the sole au vin blanc should have
that air? Take it away."</p>

<p>"Pardon, M'sieu. You understand,&mdash;a moment
more or less and a sauce is spoiled. I am grieved that
you should wait, but one dines well or one has not dined
at all. In a moment you shall have a fish that will be
as it should be. You have always the same burgundy,
yes? I, too, am of your opinion. It is the best in
our cellars."</p>

<p>He hurries away, soft-stepping, alert, diplomatic,
napkin over arm, bowing deferentially here and there.
A millionaire they say&mdash;but certainly a restaurant-keeper
who knows his business, such a one as France
can produce and Paris can appreciate.</p>

<p>There is another restaurateur in Paris whose name
should not be left out of any discussion of Parisian
dining. A few years ago he would have had no right
to a place in this frivolous chapter, for though his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
restaurant was famous it was not smart. The gourmet
might dine there&mdash;or rather lunch there&mdash;but the
woman of fashion never found her way down to the
little old building whose battered sign of a silver tower
proclaimed that here was the Tour d'Argent, the café
over which presided the inimitable Frederic, Roi des
Canards, last of the old school of French cooks and
hosts.</p>

<p>Even now the modish Parisienne does not go to
the Tour d'Argent, but Americans have taken up the
old café, and pretty women and elegant frocks are now
no strangers in the Tour d'Argent, though one could
not call the place fashionable.</p>

<p>The wine merchants of the Halles des Vins could
swear that, fine frocks or no fine frocks, Frederic deserves
a place in any chapter devoted to the fine art of
dining; for Frederic belongs to a school of cooking
which made the cuisine a fine art, and if the rooms of
the little tavern down behind the morgue offer no appeal
to the senses in the form of music and flowers and jewels
and chiffons, they offer eating and drinking good enough
to offset many omissions.</p>

<p>The Tour d'Argent has been a restaurant for three
hundred years, and looking out from its windows over
the cité patrons have been able to see most of the great
events of Paris taking place, but M. Frederic is considerably
less old than his café.</p>

<p>The Halles des Vins stand only a little way below
the restaurant, and the wine merchants learned to go
to Frederic's for luncheon. They were a high-living,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
exacting group of gourmets, patrons to appreciate good
cooking and put a cook upon his mettle. Incidentally
they knew a thing or two about wines, and through
their friendly advice and favour the cellars of Frederic
became, in the opinion of many connoisseurs, the best
in Paris.</p>

<p>Others beside the wine-merchants found their way
to the sign of the silver tower. The fame of Frederic
spread through Paris and beyond. Last year in Nice,
a New York man asked the chef of a noted hotel to
prepare for him a "canneton à la presse." "Cook
it for me just as Frederic does it," said the American.
The chef shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"I shall be charmed to cook the duck for Monsieur,
but to cook it as le Roi des Canards cooks it?&mdash;Non,
I have not the skill."</p>

<p>Tribute from a rival is tribute indeed. Frederic is
King of the Ducks, and he sits alone upon his throne.</p>

<p>You will probably find the king in the little ante-room
to his restaurant if you go down to the Tour d'Argent
early enough to have a talk with its autocrat. There
in the little ante-room are displayed game, meats, delicacies,
dozens of things a patron might like to order for
his meal, and there stands Frederic, a typical French
host, with his long grey frock-coat clinging lovingly to
his portly body, his side whiskers framing his ruddy,
beaming face, his napkin or towel over his arm.</p>

<p>If he has seen you before he will know you. If he
has seen you twice, you and he are old friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>His face takes on more luminous cheer as he catches
sight of you, and he bows profoundly, with a dramatic
flourish of the napkin.</p>

<p>"Ah, bon soir, M'sieu. Tout va toujours bien?&mdash;et
Madame?&mdash;et le petit?"</p>

<p>He leads you into the restaurant and finds a table for
you. The important matter of the dinner is settled,
and then, if you are of the favoured, Frederic will talk to
you of his art, and you will hear of refinements and
subtleties of cookery which will make you smile until
Frederic has proved to you that they are not poetic
fancy but substantial fact. Your quail, for example,
must be cooked before a grape-vine fire. Nothing but
grape-vine will do the trick. Frederic is very positive
on that point, and if you are skeptic, he may perhaps
take you out and show you the grape-vine fire. Afterward
you eat the quail and skepticism melts away into
unquestioning faith.</p>

<p>That is only one of the mysteries of Frederic's cuisine.
The man loves his art, goes to all lengths to achieve the
results he desires, would rather invent a successful sauce
than inherit a million, is as proud of his canneton à la
presse as is a painter or poet of his masterpiece. On
the whole, a majority of the public would probably prefer
the masterpiece of Frederic to that of the poet or the
painter, and in the chef's own mind there would be no
doubt as to the comparative excellence of poem, picture,
and duck.</p>

<p>It takes three ducks to supply one duck to a patron
at Frederic's. The two extra birds give up their juices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
for the sauce that is served with the bird&mdash;that wonderful
sauce which Frederic makes himself in the double
brazier or chafing-dish which he sets on a side table
near the diner.</p>

<p>It is a treat to watch the making of that sauce, from
the moment when, after touching a match to the first
brazier burner, Monsieur daintily takes up some of the
flame between his forefinger and thumb and deposits it
upon the other burner, to the final moment when with
an air of triumph the artist announces his complete
success.</p>

<p>It is a treat too to see Frederic come and serve the
duck. You are not getting your money's worth if he
does not do it himself.</p>

<p>And it is a treat, beyond the telling, to eat the duck
and the sauce which le Roi des Canards has prepared.</p>

<p>Small wonder that there are smart folk mingled with
the marchands des vins at the Tour d'Argent nowadays,
and that the birds of passage flitting through Paris go
to Frederic's for a dinner or a luncheon.</p>

<p>Marguery is another of the chefs of the old French
school, but he has become business man rather than
chef, as have most of the restaurateurs of Paris. Only
Frederic devotes himself passionately to his art, lives for
his cuisine, burns his grape-vine fires, and makes a
religious rite of preparing his sauces.</p>

<p>He is not only Roi des Canards, but the last of a
royal line.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">ROUND THE NORMANDY CIRCUIT WITH MADAME</p>

<p class="pn p2">A slight hush falls upon the fashionable Parisian
world after Grand Prix has rung down the curtain upon
the Paris season. The élégantes pause to draw breath
before plunging into the swirling tide of the summer
circuit, but the breathing time is short. A few leisurely
days, a few final visits to dressmakers and milliners, a
closing of town houses, and then, ho for Trouville.</p>

<p>There are many popular resorts on the Normandy
coast, but Trouville is queen of them all in so far as
smart Parisian society is concerned. Madame follows
the races and is in evidence at every fashionable racing
event of the Normandy circuit, from the opening at
Caen to the close at Ostend&mdash;or at least to the last of
the French courses at Dieppe; but she is merely a bird
of passage at the shifting rendezvous. Her summer nest
is at Trouville-Deauville.</p>

<p>They are practically one resort, these two places of
hyphenated association. Familiars even shorten the
name to Trou-Deauville; but the little ferry that crosses
the river Tuch between the two towns, and is heavily
freighted with holiday-making folk from morning until
night, traverses a gulf wider than the casual traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
would imagine. Trouville has the Casino, the promenade
des planches, the Rue de Paris, the famous Hôtel
de Paris; but Deauville has the race course, the hyperswell
club, the villas of the ultra-chic. All the world is
eligible to the pleasures of Trouville&mdash;or at least such
share of the world as has the price at which Trouville
pleasures are rated&mdash;but Deauville is for the favoured
few, for the crowd of Puteaux and la Boulié, and the
Polo Club of the Bois. The races draw the human
potpourri of Trouville across the ferry; but after the
races, the ferry carries the crowd back, while the social
elect move on to the exclusive club grounds for polo or
tennis or tea. A small distinction when put into mere
words, but a mighty matter as viewed by the Parisienne,
and there are many women whose whole ambition but
compasses the crossing of that expressive hyphen in
Trouville-Deauville.</p>

<p>The seashore season opens on the first of July, and
from that time on to the first of September the villas
and hotels of Trou-Deauville are filled with the most
fashionable folk of Europe, though there is much
skurrying about the coast in automobile, coach, or train,
and constant interchange of social courtesies with the
owners of villas in neighbouring resorts. The Normandy
shore line is crowded with picturesque little
villages of more or less ancient fame and more or less
fashionable repute, and there are Parisians who deliberately
choose villas at these smaller resorts, even when
they might have the entrée at Deauville, did they elect
to join the crowd there. Life at the little place is better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
for the children than life at Trouville, and it is possible
for the elders to relax slightly in the quieter atmosphere,
though they can easily find feverish gaiety within motoring
distance when they care to go in search of it.</p>

<p class="b1">They are charming, these little Normandy towns, but
it would be difficult for a town not to be charming on
the Normandy coast. To be sure the average seashore
villa of France is a blot on the landscape, but there are
exceptions to the rule,&mdash;quaint modern houses of true
Norman type,&mdash;and there are, too, old timbered farmhouses
and picturesque châteaux which have been
invaded by the tide of Parisian modernity. Even the
ugliest of the villas is likely to have a delightful little
garden, and over many of the architectural horrors
charitable roses clamber riotously, softening the hideous
outlines and bringing the dissonant notes into harmony
with the melody round about. Green fields and fruitful
orchards run down to meet the sea, and smooth white
poplar-fringed roads that are the joy of the automobilist
run away in every direction through the smiling fertile
country. Broad shining beaches stretch along beside
the sunlit waves and are dotted with gay striped tents
under which children play in the sand and grown-ups
idle away the hours. Perhaps a mediæval church and
a quaint market-place form a background for the summer
settlement, and sturdy Norman fisher folk come and go
among the holiday aliens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Yes, they are charming, these little places, and they
are, too, more exclusively French than most of the larger
resorts,&mdash;but not more French than Trouville. Nothing
could be more French than Trouville. Dieppe has a
tremendous American, English, Austrian, German,
Russian contingent that elbows the French element;
Boulogne is given over largely to bank-holiday crowds
from England; Ostend is more cosmopolitan than
French; but Trouville is of the French Frenchy, and to
know Trouville is to know the Parisienne in her gayest
summer rôle.</p>

<p>A popular French seashore resort must be seen to be
appreciated, and no American whose theories of seaside
customs is limited to an acquaintance with the shore
resorts of Jersey, Long Island, Massachusetts, etc., can
have the slightest conception of seaside life in a French
translation. There is, in the latter, a spice, a colour, an
audacity, lacking in the Anglo-Saxon version. An English
or American imitation of Trouville would be hopelessly
vulgar, but Trouville&mdash;well, it <i>is</i> Trouville. It
is all bubble, sparkle, brilliancy, extravagance, folly.
It is Paris with an added <i>laissez aller</i>, Paris set to a new
tune. There is much to shock the sober-minded as
there is in Paris, but the sober-minded should not go to
Trouville. It is the refuge of the light-hearted, the
buoyant, the volatile; and soberness has no place in its
scheme. What would electrify Newport, Bar Harbor,
even Narragansett Pier, will not create even a ripple of
excitement at Trouville. Someone has said that the
difference between smart society in New York and in
Paris is the difference between the immoral and the
unmoral. French seashore life in its most exaggerated
phase is distinctly unmoral, but like Paris life, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
is also distinctly picturesque. The most shocking thing
about Gallic impropriety is the fact that it fails to
shock.</p>

<p>But when one talks of morals, one is taking Trouville
seriously, and to take Trouville seriously is altogether
out of the question. It is all froth and effervescence, all
laughter and irresponsibility. Beau monde, bourgeoisie,
actresses, dressmakers, milliners, cocottes, titled folk
and millionaires from all over the world, gamblers,
racing touts, English polo players, American yacht
owners&mdash;all jostle each other on the promenade, in
the Casino, at the Hôtel de Paris; for the exclusive set
of Deauville does not cling to its own select haunts but
crosses the ferry often in search of diversion less monotonously
comme il faut.</p>

<p>The Rue de Paris is the great meeting-place for this
class during the morning hours, and on a bright August
morning one may find the most noted social celebrities
of Europe grouped before the doors of the little shops
that line the crooked street.</p>

<p>The jewellers and dressmakers of Paris have branch
establishments here, and around their thresholds flutter
the women who are the best patrons of those Paris
tradesfolk, met to flirt and gossip and show in their
frocks and jewels what may be achieved with the assistance
of the firms whose names are written large above
the open doors. It is called La Potinière, the gossip
rendezvous, this little Rue de Paris, and there is gossip
enough abroad there on any morning to justify the name.
There is so much excuse for gossip at Trouville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Eleven o'clock is the magic hour that really opens the
ball at Trouville. Before that, there may possibly have
been a private pigeon shoot, but that calls out only a
small clique and takes in one of the most exclusive sets
of Europe. No entrance here for the rank and file even
of the fashionable world, and no open sesame for women
whom the haughty dames of the French aristocracy do
not put upon their visiting list. If Monsieur and
Madame appear together anywhere at Trouville it is
likely to be at the pigeon shoot.</p>

<p>But it is at eleven that the doors of the villas and
hotels fly open. Out flock all of the somebodies and a
choice assortment of nobodies, and every path to the
beach is filled with the gay throng. Not that all of the
Trouville world takes a dip in the surf. No indeed,&mdash;the
truly smart folk scorn sea bathing, but they go to
the beach to meet each other, to watch the throng, to
promenade, to show their pretty morning frocks, to put
in the time until déjeuner, and their decorative value in
the bathing hour scene is tremendous.</p>

<p>Those women who do intend to go into the water, or
to wear fetching bathing costumes at a safe distance
from the waves, dress in their own rooms, if they live
anywhere near the beach, and issue cloaked, hatted, and
followed by maids. The maid is an essential feature of
the scenic effect. She carries anything that may be
needed, and she gives cachet to her mistress. There is
a theory, too, that she represents the proprieties. It is
quite improper to go to the beach without a maid, and so
the Parisienne, no matter how lurid her reputation nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
how startling her attire, goes beachward with her maid
trotting demurely at her heels.</p>

<p>The bathing at Trouville is not particularly picturesque,
though much imaginative description of its
startling features has been written, and conditions at the
resort seem favourable for a spectacular display of sea
nymphs. Trouville is the summer paradise of Parisian
cocottes, and the average Parisian cocotte is not as a
rule strikingly averse to conspicuous rôles; but Narragansett
Pier can show, during one fine summer day,
more audacious bathing costumes than will be seen
at Trouville in a week; and though little chorus girls
up from Paris for a holiday may tumble about in the
waves, among a crowd of bathers that but repeats the
bathing types familiar the world over, the notorious
"filles" do not go into the water any more than do the
great ladies of Deauville.</p>

<p>There are some piquant and attractive bathing costumes
worn on the sands by women who do not go in
for serious bathing, but the Trouville show at the
bathing hour is under the gay striped tents or on the
promenade, where women in Paris frocks and hats chat
lightly with men in informal summer attire, and where
the grande dame of the Faubourg St. Germain touches
elbows with the cocotte of the Boulevards.</p>

<p>After the bathing hour the crowd scatters again to
the hotels and villas, and though in the afternoon there
is an immense and amusing crowd on the promenade,
the very smart set is not seen there again until the next
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>It is so very busy, this smart set. The days are not
long enough for the goings and comings that must be
crowded into them. The fashionable women make
elaborate toilettes for déjeuner at café or club or villa,
and after the déjeuner they pour out upon the terraces,
arrayed in their most ravishing costumes. Automobiles,
coaches, smart traps of all kinds, are in waiting. Madame
enters the one that is to have the honour of harbouring
her mousseline and silk and lace, lifts her exquisite
sunshade, scatters smiles and gay jests among her
friends, and is off to the races.</p>

<p>Not even at Auteuil, Chantilly, or the Grand Prix can
one see more superb and extravagant costuming than in
the Tribune or the pesage at Trouville. The crowd is
less mixed than at the Paris races and there is more
uniform elegance of dress, while the beautiful pesage
with its velvety turf, its masses of bloom, its shaded
paths, offers the most delightful of settings in which to
display the latest creation of Paquin, or a daring but
successful innovation from Reboux.</p>

<p>The club of Deauville provides a scenic arrangement
even more perfectly adapted to the great show of frocks
and mondaines, than is the pesage, and here is the centre
of that exclusive social life of which the outsider can form
but a vague idea, though the other side of Trouville may
afford him most enjoyable entertainment. The golf
course of the club is said to be the finest on the continent,
the tennis courts are always full, polo is played there by
the crack players of all Europe, and there is never a time
when there is not something amusing on the club tapis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps, instead of races or club events, a garden party
at one of the Deauville villas claims the fashionables.
Or perhaps the garden party is in some nearby resort
such as Houlgate or Villers, and the clean white road
leading to the rendezvous is crowded with automobiles
and traps as the appointed hour approaches. The
automobile has added much to the gaiety of the Normandy
season. It has brought the resorts closer together,
has made intimate social intercourse between
them more possible. For great social events, the clans
gather from every direction, coming even from far-away
spas and châteaux. Wherever the races are in progress,
there a host of automobiles makes its appearance,
each machine laden with a jolly party from some one
of the innumerable Normandy resorts. There is much
motoring, too, in quest of luncheon or dinner. Madame
and her friends forsake the Parisian cuisine of the Trouville
hotel and motor merrily along the wonderful road
to Caen, where in one of the quaint old restaurants that
huddle near the market-place, one may have the best of
Norman cooking and enjoy&mdash;or at least sample&mdash;one
of the tripe dinners for which the restaurant is
famed. A vulgar dish, tripe&mdash;but not tripe à la mode
de Caen. The chef will tell you proudly that there
are fifty Norman ways of cooking tripe, each more
masterly than the other, and he will prove to you that
the ordinary domestic tripe is to the tripe of Caen as
the fried egg of the Bowery restaurant to the <i>&oelig;ufs sur
le plat</i> of the Café Foyot,&mdash;or to the omelette of
Madame Poulard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The omelette of Madame Poulard is another excuse
for a motor pilgrimage from Trouville. One goes all
the way to Mont St. Michel for it, but the run is a beautiful
one and the omelette would be well worth even
a journey over a corduroy road. Rural Normandy
and Brittany still make pilgrimages to the shrine of
the Archangel St. Michel, but even the pious pilgrims
make their obeisance to the famous omelette as well
as to the worthy saint, and the motor parties from Trouville
know more about omelette than shrine. They
are not profoundly pious, ces gens là, but they see the
beauty of the sacred mountain where it towers between
sea and sky, and they appreciate the omelette which
Madame, with due ceremony, makes in a great casserole
over the glowing logs in her cavernous fireplace.</p>

<p>And then there is Dives, with its ancient hostellerie
Guillaume le Conquerant, whose praises have been
sung so often and so eloquently that even a mere mention
of its charms seems rank plagiarism. All the
Trouville crowd motors over to Dives for luncheon or
for dinner, and divides the tables with other motor
parties from Paris and from all the country round; for
it is famous, this inn of William the Conqueror, the
most picturesque and popular of the provincial taverns
of France.</p>

<p>The great William himself saw to the building of the
inn when he chose Dives as the most convenient place
in which to build the boats needed for his little excursion
to England; and since that far day a multitude of
famous personages has found shelter there, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the place has not always been used for an inn. Kings
and queens of France have slept under the low roof,
Madame de Sévigné and other great ladies of her day
dined in the feudal dining-room and chatted in the
Salle des Marmousets.</p>

<p>But the rooms were not, in Madame de Sévigné's
time, what they are now. Monsieur Paul has made
of his old Norman inn a treasure-house. He is artist,
antiquary, and inn-keeper, this quiet M. Le Remois,
and his inn is his hobby as collecting is his passion.
He has ransacked the hidden places of Europe for rare
and wonderful things that would add beauty and interest
to the three low-raftered rooms in which he serves
private dinners and luncheons and suppers, and his
collection has overflowed into every corner of the inn.
Fourteenth-century glass gleams like jewel mosaic in
some of the windows; marvellous old tapestries, rare
antique carvings, embroideries, brasses, ivories, laces,
porcelains are everywhere, yet all are disposed with an
eye to artistic effect and the result is a harmonious
interior, not a museum jumble of curios. Even in the
kitchen, antiquity holds sway; the carved cupboards and
walls are rich in old Normandy brasses and in porcelains
and pottery that would drive a collector wild with
covetousness. Up in the sleeping-rooms that open from
a vine-embowered gallery are old carved bedsteads
and presses and dressing-tables, quaint chintzes, ewers
and basins and bric-à-brac and candelabra of a far-away
time. They are named for illustrious visitors
who have slept in them, these chambers along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
rambling galleries. One, with seventeenth-century coquetry,
is sacred to Madame de Sévigné. Another
bears the name of Dumas; for Dumas and all the other
famous writers, artists, bohemians of France have at
one time or another frequented the inn at Dives. From
the galleries one looks down upon a courtyard surrounded
by the timbered, gable-roofed, many-winged
old building. It is all abloom with flowers, this court.
Doves flutter and coo about the low eaves and the niches
in which stand queer, stiff, archaic images. Flamingoes
and herons and peacocks pick their way over the cobblestones.
Cockatoos swing from mullioned windows.</p>

<p>And into this place of mediæval memories come the
worldly moderns of Trouville and Paris. They flutter
about the courtyard scattering the doves, and rivalling
the peacocks and flamingoes in brilliance of plumage.
They make their toilettes in the low-ceilinged rooms
off the vine-draped galleries, they lunch and dine in the
Salle des Marmousets, or the Chambre de la Pucelle,
among the marvellous carvings and tapestries and
bibelots.</p>

<p>An American millionaire once offered M. Paul five
hundred thousand dollars for the feudal dining-room
just as it stood, woodwork, fireplace, glass, furnishings
and all. Doubtless he had visions of sensational New
York dinners framed in such setting, but the dream
was a vain one. Sell a part of the inn? M. Paul would
sell as readily his head or heart, but millionaires do not
always understand the artist temperament.</p>

<p>The meals served in the treasure rooms are worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of their setting, for the artist is a prince of inn-keepers
as well as a connoisseur of parts; and some of his dishes
have long been the joy of Parisian epicures and the
despair of Parisian chefs. There, for example, is his
poulet vallée d'Auge. One sees the name upon Parisian
menus now, but one tastes the real thing only in the
dining-rooms of the old inn at Dives. Here is a luncheon
menu prepared for a motor party from Trouville,
a menu not too long, but calculated to call up to the
gourmet who has lunched in the Salle des Marmousets
memories of past delights.</p>

<p class="pn10 p1">Potage Dives.<br />
Melon.<br />
Sole à la Normande.<br />
Poulets à la vallée d'Auge.<br />
Aloyau Hastings.<br />
Pêches flambées à la Guillaume le Conquerant.<br />
Gallette.<br />
Fruits.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">Oh, that fish sauce, those little chickens cooked in
fresh cream, those peaches flavoured with other fruits
and dropped in raspberry syrup and brandy&mdash;all eaten
from a genuine fifteenth-century carved table in a room
that might serve for a curio collector's dream of heaven!
Verily the epicureans of Trouville and Paris should
mention M. Le Remois in their prayers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-149.jpg" width="400" height="305"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">A sound all modern comes in through the Gothic
doorway and wakens the group around the fifteenth-century
tables from their dream of bliss. The car is
waiting in the courtyard and driving the cockatoos to
hysteria. There is a hasty donning of dust-coats, a
climbing into the huge touring-car, an exchange of
compliments with M. Paul, a waving of hands, and
then the long white road through a green, green land,
and Trouville in time for polo and dinner and the
Casino.</p>

<p>Such excursions are now essential features of the
seashore life. Trouville is motor-mad as is Paris,
and last season there was not half enough garage room
to accommodate the crowd. At every hour of the
day great machines dash up to the hotels and unload
well-known men and women from Hamburg, from
Carlsbad, from Vichy, from Vienna, from Berlin, from
Brittany, from Paris, from anywhere and everywhere.
The King of Greece arrives at the Hôtel Paris in a
Mercedes, the Shah of Persia spins blithely up to the
Casino in a Panhard, a Russian Princess steers her
motor into the narrow winding way of the Rue de Paris
and brings it up with quick turn before Doucet's popular
corner or in front of the fashionable pâtisserie.
An English Duke has run up from Boulogne in his
Daimler, the American Millionaire has made sixty
miles an hour from Paris in his Packard, in order to
meet his yacht in the bay of Deauville. It is an automobile
show of the finest, the grande semaine at Trouville,
and, later, automobile week at Ostend brings
together a host of cars even more cosmopolitan, just
as it brings together a crowd of folk still more cosmopolitan,
than that of Trouville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Yachting, too, is an important feature of Trouville
life, and the bay is always well filled with sleek sea-going
craft during grand semaine. Few of the very large
yachts are French, but a fleet of beautiful small yachts
has sailed up the Seine from Melun which is the anchorage
for the Yacht Club of France, and there are a few
imposing yachts flying the French colours. Trim English
and American yachts by the dozen anchor off the Trouville
shore for the great week, and there is a constant
going and coming between boats and shore, a perpetual
interchange of courtesies between the smart folk of
villas and hotels, and the yachting visitors. Sometimes
it is not the villa set that lunches and dines aboard the
yacht. There are hilarious doings out there on the sea,
when certain parties from the Hôtel de Paris are entertained,
but those who hear tales of these doings when
they stroll through la Potinière only shrug their shoulders,
What can one expect when the season at Trou-Deauville,
according to the traditional phrase, "bat son plein"?</p>

<p>Evening at Trouville means an elaborate dinner at
one of the private villas or hotels, and an hour or two
at the Casino, or perhaps some private social function
following in the wake of a dinner&mdash;dancing, bridge,
music, theatricals. The Hôtel de Paris is the public
dining-place par excellence, the best vantage-ground
from which to watch the passing show, but it is no easy
matter to secure a table at the Hôtel de Paris during the
height of the season. The most extravagant and modish
part of the Trouville crowd&mdash;aside from the occupants
of the handsomest villas&mdash;is quartered at the Hôtel de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Paris. A crowd quite as swell but more inclined to
quiet goes to the Grand Hôtel de Deauville, but rooms
at this hotel are all taken months in advance by folk
belonging to the Deauville set. The Hôtel de Paris
rooms are reserved far in advance, too, but by a clientèle
less exclusive. Money is the one essential at the Hôtel
de Paris, but one must have plenty of that. There are
always famous mondaines, millionaires, royal personages,
staying at the Paris; but there, too, one finds the Parisian
demi-mondaine, the noted jockey, the great actress, the
wealthy tourist, and the worthy bourgeois of Paris will
often save thriftily all year in order that he may afford
a week at the Paris during the season. It is chic to stay
at the Paris, and it is vastly amusing. Incidentally it is,
as has been hinted, expensive. To have the humblest
and scrappiest of rooms one must pay at least six dollars
a day, and the prices of suites run up into appalling
sums. Restaurant prices, too, are monumental and tips
are no small item. The waiter who serves one is the
most ingratiating, the most efficient, the most knowing of
his kind, but if one does not give the suave Shylock the
full ten per cent of his bill, which is the letter of his bond,
it will be much better not to come back again. They
have retentive memories, those waiters; they are used to
lavish generosity&mdash;and tables are always at a premium.</p>

<p>It is practically impossible to secure a table for dinner
without first enlisting the head waiter's sympathy by a
discreet tip of from five to fifty francs, and a thousand
francs has been paid for a table during grande semaine.
The cuisine is not remarkable&mdash;not so good, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
as that of the Paris Café de Paris, which is under the
same management; but much beside food goes to make
up one's money's worth when the coveted table has at
last been obtained, and there are few things more amusing
to a student of men, women, and things than to sit in
some corner of the café and watch the world go by.
To thoroughly appreciate the show one should have,
across the table, a friend who is versed in the gossip of
the European capitals, and who can name the diners and
tell their stories; but even the stranger within the gates
can get a vast amount of entertainment out of the
heterogeneous crowd, the amazing types, the beautiful
clothes, the superb jewels, and many of the stories are
written so plainly that he who runs may read.</p>

<p>After dinner the crowd drifts into the great Casino
and now for a certain part of the idlers begins the serious
business of the day. It is the custom to say that there
is no high play in France to-day and that the great days
of gambling are over, but every year folk go away from
Trouville who could furnish circumstantial evidence to
refute that theory. Play is more guarded than it once
was. The gambling does not jump at the eyes. On
the first floor of the Casino near the music a few modest
tables of petits chevaux attract a crowd of players whose
heaviest plunging is but a matter of a few francs, and
many transient visitors go away thinking that this outfit
represents the gambling of Trouville; but habitués of the
place know better than that. Up on the second floor
there are trente et quarante and baccarat, but even here
the limit is not high. Many women surround the tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
here, and women make up a large percentage of the crowd
admitted to the tables of the third floor, where play runs
high and admittance is not altogether easy to obtain;
but on the fourth floor are tables from which women are
barred and to which only the men accustomed to play
for very high stakes are welcomed. Here is the innermost
circle of the Trouville gambling Inferno, and here
are found men whose very names ooze money. Here
are found, too, men who have no colossal fortunes
behind them, but who can play high because they are
willing to risk all they have. A Rothschild, a Vanderbilt,
a Menier, may rub shoulders at the tables, but they will
perhaps have an actor, a restaurant proprietor, and a
great dressmaker for vis-à-vis, and no one is playing for
less than one thousand dollars a point. Last season an
American actor was one of the heavy losers in this fourth-floor
room, but a theatrical manager evened things up
by cashing in a goodly heap of counters representing
ten thousand dollars each at the end of a spectacular
evening's play in which several of the wealthiest men of
Europe took a hand. Men have been beggared at these
tables. One prominent racing man lost his stables down
to the last horse and bridle in an evening of play. A
famous English yacht changed hands as a result of an
hour at baccarat. Some of those who are knowing in
such matters contend that the heaviest gambling in the
world to-day goes on in the Trouville Casino during
grande semaine, but one gives that statement for what
it is worth, and authentic gambling statistics are not
easy to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to cover the gambling, the Casino ranks as a
club, though everybody gets in&mdash;at least on the first
floor. While fortunes are changing hands overhead,
down here all is light and laughter and mirth. There is
no drinking, but that does not trouble thirsty folk for
there is first aid near at hand in the Café de Paris; and
dinner is still a recent memory. The music is always
good and there is dancing for those who want it. Perhaps
some popular chanteuse or dancer from Paris is a feature
of the evening entertainment, or there may be a costume
ball or an effective cotillon. The best theatrical companies
of Paris play in the little theatre, and always there
are the petits chevaux to offer amusement of a mildly
exciting sort.</p>

<p>All goes merrily until eleven o'clock, then the crowd
pours out into the night, the doors close, the lights go
out, and the great building stands dark and grim until
morning. The board walk is thronged for a time with
late strollers, but it is a poor imitation of Atlantic City's
pride, this narrow board walk stretching from the Hôtel
de Paris to the Rochers Noirs. Only Ostend can offer
a board walk that appeals to Americans as something
approaching the real thing.</p>

<p>The strollers melt away from the promenade, the
cafés empty, and at a fairly respectable hour Trouville
is given over to quiet and night shadow. Late hilarity
is the exception rather than the rule, but enough gaiety
is crowded into the hours between eleven <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and
midnight to last the ordinary summer resort for a
fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Dieppe, of course, echoes certain notes of the Trouville
season and is as gay in its own way, though it has not
the fine sparkle of the more Parisian resort nor such an
exclusively chic villa set as that of Deauville.</p>

<p>One hears as much English as French in the Hôtel
Royale and the Casino and on the beach, and more
swell Americans congregate at Dieppe than at any other
one of the European summer resorts. For the great
racing week crowds flock in, as at Trouville, from all
the coast and inland resorts, and in at least one feature
the Dieppe races surpass any others of the seashore
circuit. No finer natural steeple chase course is known
to the racing world than that at Dieppe, and the steeple
chase races there are events that make a notable sensation
even among the many sensations of the Normandy
season.</p>

<p>At Ostend it is German that disputes supremacy with
French, and there are more Austrians and Germans
there than at any other place on the Jockey Club racing
circuit, but one misses the familiar Parisian faces, for
my lady of Deauville does not often go to Ostend even
for the grande quinzaine of August; and, oddly enough,
even the "filles de Paris" do not make much of the
Ostend season.</p>

<p>The crowd is an immense and interesting one even
without the French element, and money is spent as
prodigally as at Trouville&mdash;even more prodigally perhaps
and a trifle more crudely. The Café de la Plage
has the reputation of being one of the most expensive
places in the world in which one may order a dinner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the promenade, as has been said, is the best on the coast,
and the Kursaal is one of the finest in Europe. The
programme of the days is as crowded as that of Trouville,
and life at Ostend moves at a breathless pace,&mdash;tennis
tournaments, golf tournaments, automobile races,
motor-boat races, horse races, children's fêtes, balls,
flower festivals, theatre, excursions, déjeuners, dinners,
yachting&mdash;but the list is endless. There is gambling,
too, at Ostend. Gambling cuts comparatively little
figure at Dieppe, and the Belgian government has
muzzled it at Ostend, but here as in Paris one may
always play at one's private club, and there is a private
club at Ostend where during the quinzaine play rivals
that of the famous fourth-floor room at Trouville during
grande semaine. Many of the same players are in evidence
in both places, but at Ostend entrance to the
club is a very serious matter. The king of Belgium,
notorious viveur and most practical sovereign, has been
extremely firm in regard to Ostend play, and permits it
only on the guarantee of the club that no scandal shall
arise to discredit the little Belgian country. Any serious
gambling fracas would mean an immense forfeit to the
government, and consequently rigid measures are taken
to safeguard the play. Anyone desiring admission must
be introduced by reliable members and his name
must be posted for three days before he is accepted.
No exceptions are made, and a rich American who
presented written introductions from two of the best
known and wealthiest men of Europe last season was
promptly turned down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"These gentlemen are members. We know them
well. Monsieur is doubtless altogether eligible, but our
rules are our rules. We cannot accept cards of introduction,
but if Monsieur will come here with sponsors
who are members&mdash;"</p>

<p>Money would not buy the entrée. The directors of
the Ostend Club take no chances. They leave that to
the gamblers at the club tables.</p>

<p>With Ostend the season ends, and during the next
week all of the expresses running to Paris are crowded
with homing holiday folk. Dinard and the other Brittany
resorts have been crowded as has Normandy, but
Dinard is not so popular with the smart Parisienne as is
Trouville, and money is not spent so lavishly in the
Brittany resorts as in those of Normandy. Some Parisians
of the fashionable set have wandered to Switzerland
or to German or French spas. Others have spent the
summer in quiet country houses and châteaux far from
fashion's haunts; but from all quarters they flock to
Paris when August is past, and Paris welcomes them
with smiles. She has amused herself after a fashion,
but the summer has been long and a trifle dull.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE MERRY-GO-ROUND</p>

<p class="pn p2">The Parisienne adores Paris, but she is subject to
acute attacks of that modern malady to which the leisure
class is peculiarly susceptible, and which one of Madame's
countrymen has aptly called the "nostalgie
d'ailleurs"&mdash;homesickness for elsewhere.</p>

<p>Moved by that spirit of restlessness she forsakes Paris&mdash;in
order that she may better love that city of her
heart. She does not yearn for rest, but she wants change,
and so she goes flitting here and there within easy reach
of Paris&mdash;always within easy reach of Paris. Her
fashion circuit is circumscribed by that national sentiment
which makes the average Frenchman an unhappy
and protesting alien anywhere outside of la belle
France.</p>

<p>Madame goes to Monte Carlo; for the Côte d'Azur
Rapid has made the Riviera resorts mere suburbs of
Paris. She goes to Tangiers; for, after all, Tangiers is
France, and in the French quarter of that picturesque
place one finds a limited edition of Parisian society.
But as for Cairo&mdash;no. The fashion show in Cairo,
during the height of the season, is a great one, but it is
furnished chiefly by English and Americans, and one
finds few smart French folk in the throng. The Pyramids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
are too far from the Avenue des Acacias and the
Rue de la Paix.</p>

<p>The Monte Carlo season is not, like the seashore
season, an obligatory decampment. One may stay
away from the Riviera without imperilling one's social
position, while a summer spent in Paris would stamp
one as quite outside the social pale; and, though there
is, during January and February, a mighty going and
coming to and from the south, Paris is gay and crowded
all through the winter.</p>

<p>Great private fêtes are usually reserved for the spring
season, unless some special event calls them forth, but
there is a merry-go-round of more or less formal entertaining,
and the society woman needs an expert accountant
to keep her engagement book, and the semainier
which records the at-home days of her friends, in intelligible
order. There is time in the winter for the intimate
reunions that are likely to be crowded out in the whirl of
spring social functions, and when Bagatelle and Puteaux
and la Boulié and the other open-air rendezvous are eliminated
from the Parisienne's calculations, she can more
often meet her friends in her own home or in theirs.</p>

<p>Balls are not a remarkably important feature of the
Parisian season. There is dancing, of course, but the
Frenchmen, as a rule, do not care for it.</p>

<p>"The ball? Je m'en passe," said a society man of
Paris, when questioned about the matter.</p>

<p>"In America it is, perhaps, different. There one
dances and one sits out dances, and one converses, and
one flirts. Here, it is usually for the demoiselles that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
dances are given. You know our French girls? The
writers tell us that they are emancipated, that they know
many things. Perhaps,&mdash;but they do not show all
this at the dance. One is introduced, one takes the
girl from her mamma, one dances with her, one returns
her to her mamma. C'est finis. Gai ça, n'est-ce pas?
For the man who wishes to marry, to settle himself,
the private ball may have much interest; but for one
who seeks merely amusement, entertainment,&mdash;Grace
à Dieu, il y a d'autres choses."</p>

<p>Truly, there are other things, a multitude of them.
The Parisian hostess makes a feature of the musicale
and certain salons are famous for music of extraordinarily
good quality. Private theatricals, amateur or professional,
are a social specialty in Paris. Bridge is a passion
there as elsewhere. Parisian vivacity and buoyancy
make even the formal reception an occasion lively rather
than depressing.</p>

<p>But, when all is said, the dinner is the private social
function dearest to the Parisian heart, and the successful
Parisian hostess understands the art of dinner-giving
as do few other women in the world. An elaborate
menu and a gorgeous and extravagant decorative scheme
seldom enter into her calculations. There is a rational
number of courses, perfectly cooked, perfectly served,
there is a dainty and attractive table; but the extravagant
display, the eager striving after unique and picturesque
effects in table decoration, the costly souvenirs
which mark the formal dinner in New York, are not
often a part of the French scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the French hostess displays a tact
and finesse amounting to genius in the selection and
grouping of her guests, and, as a result, her dinner goes
off with a verve which no amount of extraneous gorgeousness
could achieve. The Parisienne of the better type,&mdash;"she
of the subtle charm, to whom every man is a
possible admirer"&mdash;has a famous opportunity for exhibiting
her charm at the dinner table&mdash;particularly at
the "little dinner." From the time she could lisp she
has been trained to please and be pleased. She lacks
the cultivated imperiousness of the American woman,
and though she too, rules, her method differs from
that of our social tyrant. Instead of demanding man's
allegiance and devotion, she sets about winning them.
She is gay, agreeable, witty, sympathetic, thoughtful
of man's little needs, indulgent of man's little foibles;
and her influence, though less assertive, is subtler than
that of the American woman who claims her throne by
divine right. Someone has said that "cherchez la
femme" is written over every phase of Parisian life,
and the thing is true. The Parisienne's influence is
felt in politics, art, business, society, and yet the Parisienne
is so essentially feminine, and the Parisian is so
sure of his supremacy, so unconscious of any bondage
save that of love or gallantry.</p>

<p>The Parisienne was born to dining. She has adopted
tea-drinking. Fifteen years ago it was almost impossible
to obtain a good cup of tea in Paris. To-day Paris is
flooded with tea. The change has come about through
the Anglomania which, within recent years, has attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Parisian society. Tea came in with polo and golf, and
English tweeds, and long walks, and all the other Anglo-Saxon
strenuousness which has disturbed French traditions.
It has become the fashion to adopt English sports,
English clothes, English customs, English slang.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman has a form of the mania less
virulent than that which has attacked the Frenchman.
She may go in for le sport, may do violence to her inclinations
and her Louis XV heels by walking,&mdash;or
as she calls it, "footing,"&mdash;may employ an English maid
and interlard her conversation with English phrases;
but she draws the line at English clothes, while the
French dandy's ultimate ambition is to be mistaken
for an Englishman, and to that end he employs London
tailors, cultivates English habits, and succeeds in being
as much like a Londoner as the Place de la Concorde
is like Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>Five o'clock tea is a matter-of-course necessity in
London. In Paris it is a fad, and to "five-o'-clocker"
is one of the unfailing diversions of the smart Parisienne,
whether mondaine or demi-mondaine.</p>

<p>Naturally, being a social fad instead of a personal
comfort, afternoon tea is seldom served to Madame
when she is alone in boudoir or salon.</p>

<p>If one is at home to one's friends, and there is an appreciative
audience for a tea-gown of rare merit, then
there is good reason to five-o'-clocker under one's own
roof; but, on the whole, the Parisienne loves better to
make a toilette worthy of applause and sally forth to
drink her tea under the eyes of her world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Columbin's was the first of the fashionable tea-rooms.
Just why the little pâtisserie on the Rue Cambon leaped
into fame, it is hard to say. Anglomania was rife, the
Parisienne needed new amusement. A shrewd pâtissier
combined the psychical moment with superior-toasted
currant muffins and cakes and tea and a convenient
rendezvous. All the smart Parisian set flocked to Columbin's,
the narrow Rue Cambon was crowded with
imposing equipages, the curb was lined with dapper
grooms, and in the little tea-rooms, between five and
six, there was one of the most impressive fashion shows
of the fashion-making city.</p>

<p>There is no need of putting the story in the past tense.
The crowd and the fashion show are still to be seen in
the Rue Cambon, though Columbin's has spread over
more space and rival tea-rooms have sprung up like
mushrooms all over Paris. On almost any corner one
may now get a good cup of tea, but among the multitude
of tea-rooms only a few have caught the fancy of
the fashionable Parisiennes.</p>

<p>Rumpelmayer's on the Rue de Rivoli is one of the
few, and is perhaps the most successful rival of Columbin's
among the Parisian mondaines; but tea hour at the
Ritz is vastly entertaining, if less exclusive, and more
cosmopolitan, while at the Elysées there is music and
things are excessively gay. "Too gay," says Madame
of the chic Parisian set, with an expressive shrug of her
shoulders, but one goes to the Elysées all the same.</p>

<p>Possibly a pretty woman is prettier in ball or dinner
toilette than in any other dress,&mdash;though one might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
take issue even with that theory; but surely individuality
and distinctive elegance count for more in street costumes
of the handsome type than in any other item of
a woman's wardrobe. The tea-hour crowd at&mdash;say
Columbin's, on a winter afternoon, diffuses an atmosphere
of luxury, elegance, richness, that even Paris
would find it hard to surpass. She is so coquette in her
velvets and broadcloth and furs, this dear Parisienne.
She steps from her carriage and passes through the door
which her groom hurries to open. Inside is a murmur
of many voices, a ripple of laughter, a rustle of silken
stuffs, a scent of violets. Madame looks about her and
smiles&mdash;an inclusive smile, for she recognizes so many
of the women who are grouped about the little tables.
Then she trails her chiffons forward in the manner
habitual with Ouida's heroines, and she stops to choose
just the little cakes she will have with her tea. The
little cakes of Paris merit consideration. She turns her
back upon the tea drinkers as she deliberates, my lady
chez Columbin. It requires supreme confidence in
one's figure and one's dressmaker to turn one's back
gracefully, carelessly, upon one's most merciless critics,
but Madame does it with nonchalance, and when she
has settled the weighty question of cakes she finds her
way to a table, stopping here and there to exchange
greetings and jests with friends. She is perfectly
gowned, wrapped in superb and becoming furs, smiling
under the shadowing brim and nodding plumes of her
great hat or under the tip-tilted absurdity of her tiny
toque. And all around her are women of the same type,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
exotic products of a society highly artificial, sensuously
material. Some of them are beautiful, some are homely,
all are extravagantly dressed, and all have made that
effort to appear beautiful which is with the Parisienne&mdash;more
than with any other woman of the world&mdash;an
absorbing passion.</p>

<p>It is this determined spirit of coquetry which leads
the mondaine of Paris to make up in a fashion which
in other cities is relegated chiefly to the class without
the social gates. The Parisienne makes up frankly,
conscientiously, with thought only of the effect obtained
and with no effort to attribute to nature the results of
her maid's skill or her own. Her cosmetics are as much
a part of her toilette as her frock or her hat, and her
French audience applauds her make-up instead of criticising.
It is coquette, this artificiality, it shows that
desire to please which is the fundamental principle of
French femininity. If one is beautiful&mdash;that is excellent.
If one is not beautiful, but makes a heroic effort
to appear so,&mdash;that too is excellent. The French
public forgives all save indifference to the true feminine
metier.</p>

<p>Over in the spacious rooms of the Ritz, at the tea
hour, one will find more English and Americans than
French, though the French go there too, and there is a
sprinkling of many nations. The crowd is more mixed
than that of the Rue Cambon, in features other than
that of nationality. Few demi-mondaines go to Columbin's.
Why?&mdash;It is hard to tell,&mdash;but they do not go.
Occasionally, demi-mondaines of the highest class drift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in, but they are out of their element. There are hardly
enough of them to give each other confidence.</p>

<p>At the Ritz things are different. There one is likely
to see the most famous half-world beauties of Paris
drinking tea, and at the Elysées the percentage of
notoriety is still greater than at the Ritz.</p>

<p>They love dearly to range themselves alongside of
the haut monde, these cocottes of Paris, but they like a
large and varied scene, a certain amount of moral&mdash;or
immoral&mdash;support. The restricted intimacy of a
rendezvous like Columbin's is not to their taste.</p>

<p>At the Palais de Glace the demi-mondaine shines.
Here is a setting to which she lends herself readily, a
setting, moreover, in which she may pose beside Madame
of the beau monde and measure charms with her.</p>

<p>Only the social elect may skate at the Cercle des
Patineurs in the Bois, and there one finds the society
women of Paris gliding over the ice or chatting around
the braziers on the banks of the horseshoe lake. It is
the most chic of social rendezvous, this skating club in
the Bois, but the weather clerk is no respecter of high
society, and there are comparatively few weeks during
the winter when open-air skating is practicable in Paris.</p>

<p>Down at the Palais de Glace on the Champs Elysées,
the management deals out artificial ice to the just and
the unjust every day during the season. Even in
October there is skating at the Palais, and it is chic
to skate then, just as it is chic to eat fresh strawberries
in January, while, during midwinter, this skating-rink
is one of the most popular afternoon resorts in Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
The Parisian skating costume is a triumph, and the
Parisiennes skate well, conscious of their own grace
and revelling in that consciousness. Some of the great
ladies of the French world are famous skaters; especially
certain members of the Russian colony; and there
are demi-mondaines too who skate marvellously well,&mdash;particularly
two or three Danish beauties, who have
taken on a Parisian lacquer. After all, it is hardly fair
that the demi-mondaine of Paris should be credited
entirely to the essential immorality of French society,
and constitute a reproach against French womanhood,
for the class is cosmopolitan to an extraordinary degree,
recruited from Spain, from Italy, from Austria, from
Russia, from Germany, from Sweden, from Denmark,
from all countries of Europe, and centred in Paris
because there are concentrated the wealth and prodigality
of a material and luxurious civilization, because
there the cocotte can live her short day so brilliantly, so
dizzily, that during it she can quite forget the inevitable
hideousness of the long days to come.</p>

<p>The little grisettes of the Latin Quarter and Montmartre
are largely French, and bear the homely French
names,&mdash;Suzanne, Rose, Marie,&mdash;but they are, on
the whole, the most honest, the least degraded and
corrupt, as they are the humblest of the class to which,
broadly speaking, they belong. A grade higher&mdash;or
lower&mdash;according to the view-point of the one who
classifies, is the little cocotte of the cafés and dance
halls, the Cri-Cri of the Casino, the Fol-Fol of the
Elysées Montmartre. When the boulevards and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
better theatres and cafés are reached, the name is prone
to take on dignity. Antoinette, Diane, Heloise appear.
And further still up the cocotte's ladder comes an insistent
"Mademoiselle" or "Madame." When the
cocotte has become truly demi-mondaine, when she
buys her clothes on the Place Vendôme, and acquires a
villa at Trouville, an hôtel in Paris, she adds Madame
to a high sounding, mouth-filling name, such as Montmorency
or Beauregard. Perhaps she even preempts a
title. There, for instance, was the Princesse d'Araignée.
She was very quiet, this Princess, very retiring, but Paris
knew her as it knew the king who was for many years
her lover, and to whom she was loyal, though he came
but seldom to Paris. He is dead now, that royal lover&mdash;a
tragic death&mdash;and the Princess&mdash;but this was
to be a story of her title.</p>

<p>The title was, on its face, self-explanatory. "The
Spider Princess" had a fine appropriateness in the half-world
of Paris. One day some one spoke jestingly of
the name. The Princess shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is really mine," she said gravely, "mine since I
was a baby."</p>

<p>The jester looked incredulous.</p>

<p>"But yes. I will tell you," said the Princess. "I
am of Normandy. You did not know? Yes, I am of
Normandy. I was born there in a little village by the
sea. Such a very little town. I can see it now. My
father was a fisherman. Big and brown and strong,
my father&mdash;and kind. But yes, of a kindness. He
loved me, and I&mdash;I adored him. My mother was good&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
honest woman, but it was my father whom I
adored. When he was at home I trotted always at
his heels&mdash;une toute petite bébé, brown and plump
and laughing always."</p>

<p>There was a big rock in the harbour&mdash;an immense
jagged rock in the water. The waves washed over it
always, save on one day during the month. Then it
was quite out of the water and it lay there like a great
spider in the sunshine, with long legs running out into
the foam. Along the coast they called it l'Araignée.</p>

<p>"It fascinated me, that big rock spider. All the month
I watched for it, and when it came up out of the sea I
cried to be taken out to it. My father took me. He
was like that always&mdash;très indulgent, mon père, and
I&mdash;what I wanted I must have.</p>

<p>"He would carry me down to his boat and row out
to the rock and then we would eat our luncheon there,
and he would tell me stories and I would play&mdash;une
bébé, vous savez. I had then but four years, and I was
happy&mdash;Dieu, que j'étais heureuse. The fisher-folk
came to know me there on my rock, to look for us, mon
père et moi, and they called me la Princesse d'Araignée.
Yes, that was my name. Everyone called me that,
smiling, and I was proud.</p>

<p>"One does not stay always a baby. I grew up, and
the father died. It was dull there in the little Norman
village. I wanted excitement, and&mdash;what I wanted
I must have, I was always like that.</p>

<p>"The story tells itself after that, n'est-ce pas? I came
to Paris, and I found the excitement. But one does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
not use the name of an honest father here in Paris. Il
était tellement bon, mon père.</p>

<p>"I remembered that I had been a princess and I
took my title once more. La Princesse d'Araignée!
You see it is really mine, the title. The rock is still
there in the sea,&mdash;but, mon père et moi&mdash;"</p>

<p>A far cry from the Palais du Glace, yet not so far
after all, as memories go; for the Princesse d'Araignée
was at the Palais du Glace one December afternoon
long ago, and her king was by her side.</p>

<p>If one does not skate, still one goes to the skating-rink.
The promenade is crowded on popular afternoons with
all the types familiar in leisure Paris. Women in airy
gowns and picture hats furnish effective contrast to the
feminine skaters in their short skirts and jaunty toques.
A fragrance of flowers and perfumes floats in the air,
the ring of the skates sounds through the swinging
melody of the music. Once more the Parisian artificiality&mdash;once
more the Parisian charm.</p>

<p>On one afternoon in the week the crowd at the Palais
takes on a most chic and exclusive tone. The prices
are higher on that day, but high prices would never shut
out the cocotte and her following. Quite the reverse.
An unwritten law accomplishes what the increased
prices would not accomplish, and Friday afternoon
smart society claims the rink for its own. That is le
jour chic at the Palais de Glace. If one goes on
other days&mdash;as one does&mdash;there is a fair field and no
favour.</p>

<p>The theatres of Paris are in full swing during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
winter, and new plays are magnets for the society set
as for all Paris; but even the smartest of Parisians are
democratic when it comes to theatre-going, and no one
or two houses claim their allegiance. The Théâtre
Français, the Odeon, les Nouveautés, les Variétés, le
Vaudeville, le Théâtre Antoine, le Théâtre Sara Bernhardt,
le Maturin,&mdash;to all of these Madame goes, and
to the cafés chantants in addition. Wherever there is
clever entertainment, there one finds the swell Parisienne.
She is catholic of taste.</p>

<p>Americans visiting Paris in summer are likely to have
a curious idea of the Parisian theatre, as of many things
Parisian. Then the better theatres are closed, the actors
are probably away with the summer holiday folk, or, if
the exigencies of their profession keep them in Paris,
they are occupying little villas at Ville d'Avray, at Bougival,
or in some other convenient suburb, whence they
can run in for rehearsals or professional business when
necessary.</p>

<p>Only the cafés chantants and the variety theatres are
open and beckoning to the summer visitors, and the
crowd at these places has little of the true Parisian character,
is made up chiefly of strangers from the colonies,
from America, from a host of regions whose summer
climates are more trying than that of Paris. The shows
are amusing in their way, the crowd is amusing too, but
neither is calculated to give one an accurate idea of
Paris theatre or of Paris theatre-goers. Indeed, one
thing about the summer attendance at Les Ambassadeurs,
le Jardin de Paris, and the other resorts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
draw the crowd during July and August, always
impresses Parisians themselves as phenomenal and
distinctly shocking. The "jeune fille" of France does
not frequent "ces coins là," but respectable American
fathers and mothers tranquilly take their daughters
with them to cafés chantants, variety theatres, even to
the dance halls of the Rive Gauche and of Montmartre.
A goodly number of these rendezvous exist solely for
the delectation of visiting strangers and, like the Moulin
Rouge, are supported chiefly by the American tourists'
money. That the Moulin Rouge is dead speaks well
for the educational development of the American traveller,
but from the ashes of the place, which had nothing
save sheer vulgarity to commend it, has risen a variety
theatre with café balconies, and some of the dance-hall
features of the old resort are retained in modified form.
The Café de la Mort, and the other melodramatic and
banal cafés, where efforts are made to provide the
visitor with a shock that will sustain the reputation of
Paris for devilish wickedness, are, like the Moulin Rouge
of unblessed memory, provided for the edification of
travellers, and supported chiefly by American dollars.
Even Maxim's, which means to the average American
the last word on Parisian impropriety, is, by Parisians
themselves, considered one of the concessions to American
and English expectations and tastes.</p>

<p>"Maxim's? Oh c'est bête ça&mdash;toujours les Americains
chez Maxim," says the Frenchman, disdainfully.</p>

<p class="b1">There is wickedness enough of a purely Parisian
flavour in Paris, heaven knows; but the lurid spectacles
provided for the tourist are perhaps the least immoral
if the most vulgar of its manifestations.</p>

<p class="p1">The Opera is a tradition of the Paris season. All of
the swell clubs have boxes and the society folk who can
afford it subscribe, yet the opera is not so important an
item of the social year in Paris as in New York, and one
will usually see more elaborate toilettes and more fashionable
women in any one of the popular theatres than at
the Opera.</p>

<p>When spring comes to Paris and the horse-chestnuts
burst into bloom, new elements enter into the merry-go-round.
The clubs in the Bois and outside of Paris
become centres of social activity, the races begin, al
fresco dining and tea-drinking are in order. Hostesses
blest with such grounds as those of Baronne Henri
Rothschild give picturesque garden parties, there are
chic evening fêtes at Puteaux, elaborate open-air charity
entertainments are organized. Riding and driving in
the Bois, which has continued languishingly during the
winter, takes on new spirit.</p>

<p>The Avenue des Acacias is thronged with carriages
and motors at the driving hours, and now and then
women descend from their carriage to promenade, to
chat with friends, to display their toilettes.</p>

<p>The Avenue des Acacias is the drive of drives for the
mixed crowd of smart folk, but the old nobility of France
prefers to drive in stately hauteur along the Avenue de
la Reine Marguerite. One must make some protest
against the levelling of class barriers.</p>

<p>The two most fashionable bridle-paths run along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
beside these two favourite driving avenues, but the
whole Bois is a paradise of bridle-paths, and near its
centre is a spot which has been chosen as the favourite
meeting-place of chic riders at certain hours. The
Parisians are riding more since things English became
the fashion, and many of them ride very well, though
the men affect English horsemanship to the point of
caricature; but, on the whole, the French are better at
haute école riding than at park riding. They make the
best circus riders in the world, but the horsemanship of
the average rider on the bridle-paths of the Bois leaves
much to be desired.</p>

<p>As for driving, there are many good whips, but the
accomplishment is not general, and few Parisiennes of
social prominence drive. It is not "convenable," and
though several of the greatest ladies of France hold the
reins over their own fine horses in the Bois, driving
alone with a groom is generally ranked in the same
category as walking alone with a dog. The woman
who does either must expect uncomplimentary classification,
unless she stands high enough to be a law unto
herself.</p>

<p>And apropos of dogs, the pet dog show is always one
of the events of the spring season, an occasion that calls
for artistic effect in mistress as well as dog, produces
scores of effective tableaux, offers testimony concerning
feminine folly. There are good dogs shown, dog aristocrats
of unimpeachable birth and breeding, but their
exhibition is enveloped in such a flurry of chiffons, such
a hysteria of pride, ambition, emotion. Nowhere in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the world has the dog endured such insults to his sturdy,
canine simplicity as in Paris. Nowhere else has he
been so dandified, so coddled, so spoiled. The pet dog
of the Parisienne of high degree is likely to be a sybarite,
and the pet dog of the famous cocotte leads a luxurious
existence that demands prodigal expenditure.</p>

<p>One Parisian dog tailor has a most flourishing and
successful business. He is the Paquin of dogdom, and
let no one think that he is not an artist. When Madame
brings her little angel to him for a spring outfit, there
is an impressive paraphrase of Madame's own sessions
with her couturier,&mdash;a serious conference concerning
materials, colours, trimmings, models. In New York
a dog blanket is a dog blanket. It may be cheap or
expensive, but it is probably bought ready made and
approximately fitted. The Parisian dog tailor considers
his client's figure, complexion, air.</p>

<p>"But no, Madame. I find that he has not the breadth
of chest to wear that model&mdash;and the colour! He is not
of a type for the blue and silver. A warm violet, now,
with the embroidery in more tender shades, and a
touch of gold? Bon! And the curving line on the
shoulder? It gives an air of slenderness, that shoulder
seam. Madame has samples of the other costumes
she wishes to match?"</p>

<p>Absurd? Of course it is all ineffably absurd, but the
mania for dress extends even to the lapdog in Paris.</p>

<p>The little angel has also his boots&mdash;of fur for the
cold, of oilskin for the dampness. He has his tiny kerchiefs
of cobweb fineness, embroidered with his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
or monogram, and tucked into the pockets of his handsome
coats. He wears jewelry, more or less costly,
collars, bangles, even bracelets. One notorious Parisienne
has a collection of jewelry for her dog that is
worth a fortune, collars of cabuchon emeralds and
diamonds, of pink pearls, of cunningly wrought gold
and lucky jade. It is a hobby of the mistress, this dog
jewelry, and when one's specialty is the speedy bankrupting
of Grand Dukes and wealthy American fledglings
and rich Portuguese Jews, one has the money for
one's hobbies.</p>

<p>The pet dog show is not a dog clothes exhibit. The
entries are judged upon their canine merits, but it is
amusing all the same, this event, and the mistresses
pose most charmingly with their pets. Nothing that
happens in Paris lacks its theatrical note.</p>

<p>The Fête des Fleurs belongs to the spring season, but
it does not belong to the smart Parisian set, though
every one turns out to see the show. The fête is given
in the name of charity, and doubtless charity covers its
sin, but there is more than a little vulgarity and horse-play
mixed with the picturesque beauty of the scene.
A part of the Bois is roped off, and an entrance fee is
charged for all sight-seers and equipages passing the
barriers. So much for charity. The rest is merry-making
of a somewhat promiscuous sort. Every seat
along the avenues is taken, masses of flowers are banked
high along the curb, to be sold as ammunition for the
battle of flowers. Bands are playing, flags are fluttering,
garlands are swinging from decorated poles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
past the judges' stand by the pigeon-shooting club files
an endless line of carriages, carts, automobiles, fiacres,
conveyances of all types, from the butcher's cart, bearing
the honest butcher and his wife and children, to the
electric victoria of the most famous dancer of Paris.
Only the chic society woman is conspicuous by her
absence. One seldom sees, in the Fête des Fleurs procession,
faces familiar in the exclusive salons.</p>

<p>But the sight is an interesting one, for all that. A
Parisian fête does not need the indorsement of the Faubourg
St. Germain in order to be gay, and the public
celebrities and demi-mondaines turn out in all their
glory for the Fête des Fleurs.</p>

<p>Pretty women look out from the riot of flowers that
covers hansom, victoria, dog-cart, phaeton, automobile,
and money has been spent like water to furnish some of
the beauties with their setting. One phaeton is literally
hidden under purple orchids, and holds two blondes
elaborately arrayed in white and violet. Behind comes
a victoria trimmed in thousands of yellow and red roses
and bearing a noted Spanish dancer. A popular opera
singer has made her motor car a moving bank of pink
roses and violets.</p>

<p>Bunches of forget-me-nots and daisies and pinks are
hurtling through the air. A popular lionne of the day
is so pelted with fragrant ammunition that she springs
up in her carriage bower and stands, a slender mousseline-draped
beauty, laughing under the rain of nosegays,
and with gay abandon returning her assailants' fire.</p>

<p>In the carriage just behind hers are two gorgeously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
gowned women, old and haggard and hideous under
their cosmetics, derelicts, favourites who have outlived
their day, and are fighting the hopeless fight against
defeat and misery and oblivion; but the beauty of the
flower battle does not look behind her and read the
memento mori. She is having her day now. What
has yesterday or to-morrow to do with a Fête des
Fleurs?</p>

<p>There are other public fêtes on the floodtide of the
Paris spring,&mdash;plebeian, many of them, and the Fête
de Neuilly is one of the most plebeian; yet it is chic to go
to Neuilly at least once while the van dwellers from all
the highways and byways of France are in camp along
the Avenue de Neuilly. From every direction the vagabonds
have gathered,&mdash;a motley crew of gipsy wanderers,
strolling entertainers who, after a winter in the
provinces, have found their way back to the borders of
the Paris they love.</p>

<p>Ramshackle booths, tents, shooting-galleries, carousels,
acrobats, fortune-tellers, snake-charmers, lion
tamers, ventriloquists, fat ladies, magicians, vendors of
every imaginable cheap and tawdry thing&mdash;the old
Coney Island multiplied by ten and invested with a
Gallic lightness and sparkle in place of its own dull
vulgarity. That is the Neuilly Fair.</p>

<p>Smart folk give jolly little dinners and, after, take
their guests out to Neuilly for a lark. They visit the
side shows, and shoot at the balls, and buy ridiculous
souvenirs, and ride on the carousel, and throw confetti,
and give themselves up to vulgar amusements with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
infantile joyousness that is a characteristic Parisian
mood.</p>

<p>Madame is very charming in all her elegant perfection
against the tawdry background of Neuilly, and she
knows that she is charming&mdash;all of which helps to
make the "Neuilly evening" a popular item on the
June programme.</p>

<p>There was once a crown prince who went to the
Neuilly Fête, and who saw a gipsy girl there. He was
bon garçon, this crown prince, and he was doing the
fête incognito and with a thoroughness that included
making friends with many of the van folk. The gipsy
girl was beautiful. She killed herself afterward, far
from Paris, in the country of the Prince, but one expects
comedy, not tragedy, of the fête de Neuilly.</p>

<p>Princes and kings are frequent visitors in Paris, and
when they come officially, everyone, from the President
of the Republic to the street-sweeper of the boulevards,
conspires to do them honour. But his Royal Highness
loves better to visit Paris incog. and amuse himself
according to his own will. He has even been known to
make an official visit, to endure with cheerful resignation
the formal entertaining lavished upon him, to be
escorted to the station by a guard of honour and high
officials, to wave a courteous adieu from his car window,
and, within forty-eight hours, to be back in Paris, incognito,
with only one or two members of his suite for
attendants and only his own tastes to be consulted in
the matter of entertainment. Even royalty is human.</p>

<p>Paris dances and sings and fiddles her way through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the spring days&mdash;as she has danced and sung and
fiddled her way through history; and when July comes
and the blinds are drawn down in the fashionable residence
quarters, still Paris is not dull.</p>

<p>Swarms of visitors from the Colonies, from Southern
Europe, from America, fill the gaps left by departing
Parisians. Restaurant tables are crowded. Les Ambassadeurs,
l'Horloge and their rivals do a flourishing
business. Only the onlooker who knows the real Paris
misses the gayest element of the Parisian world from
its accustomed haunts, and finds the Parisian summer
a dreary interregnum twixt season and season.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">THE HUNTING SEASON AT THE  CHÂTEAUX</p>

<p class="pn p2">With September, Parisians renounce their allegiance
to Neptune. For that matter, Neptune has little to do
even with the seashore season of the Parisian world.
The hoary old fellow is but a detail of the stage setting.
Whatever sovereignty he may have claimed at Trouville,
Dieppe, Dinard, he long ago made over to Venus
Anadyomene, and even she cannot hold her courtiers.
There comes a day when the sands that have for months
bloomed riotously in Parisian gowns and sunshades and
millinery, stretch away, yellow and lone, before deserted
casinos and empty hotels.</p>

<p>The seashore season is over. The hunting season is
on.</p>

<p>Venus Anadyomene has given way to Diana, goddess
of the chase. Pagan Neptune has handed the fashionable
crowd over to Christian St. Hubert, patron saint of
venery.</p>

<p>There is an element of farce in certain phases of
French hunting, for the Frenchman is born to theatrical
effects as the sparks fly upward, and the good shopkeeper
of Paris goes a-hunting in a fashion that has
been the delight of <i>Punch</i> artists for many years. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
so round and rosy and valiant and important this French
sportsman of <i>Punch</i>, his hunting costume is so elaborate,
he is so lavishly equipped with hunting paraphernalia.
The railway stations of Paris are crowded with hunters
of this class when the falling leaves are aswirl in the
forests of France; but Monsieur is only one of many
French hunting types, and the English go far astray
when they make the caricature inclusive, just as they
strain the truth when they picture the French follower
of hounds as a dapper and rotund little fop clinging
frantically round his horse's neck and shouting&mdash;"Stop
ze hunt! Stop zat fox! I tomble! I faloff! Stop ze
fox!"</p>

<p>If the London cockney should arise en masse each
October and go forth to hunt as does the bourgeois
of Paris, there would doubtless be amusing sights
in the railway stations of London; and though the
fox hunting of France does not compare favourably
with that of England, there's many a fox-hunting
English squire who would fall by the way if he
attempted to ride with a wiry French marquis on an
all day and night wolf hunt through the woods and
plains of Poitou.</p>

<p>The chase is a passion with the French, and all classes
save those to which a day's holiday, a gun, and a dog
are unattainable joys hail the advent of the shooting
season with enthusiasm. One sees the solitary hunter
in the marshes near the city, or searching patiently for
birds on ground where no placards warn trespassers
away. The toy estates that fringe the woods near Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
are carefully enclosed in high fences of wire net, and
there, on clear autumn mornings, there is a mighty
fusillade among the thickets while Monsieur in his
English tweeds, and Madame in her newest and most
impractical shooting costume, and their equally decorative
friends, play at la chasse.</p>

<p>Since the greater part of the French land is subdivided
to a remarkable degree, and the average proprietor
cannot shoot over his own place without danger of
killing the owner or the game on adjoining property,
many shooting alliances are made between groups of
men owning adjacent lands, and the privilege of hunting
over the whole territory is accorded to each of the group,
while the game killed is apportioned according to fixed
rules. There are other hunting syndicates more ambitious,
renting or owning expensive preserves in country
far from Paris, and, of course, there are the fortunate
owners of large estates who have on their own preserves
enough good shooting to satisfy even the most exacting
of English sportsmen.</p>

<p>Millionaire bourgeois own a majority of the important
preserves of Seine et Marne, Seine et Oise, and Oise,
and the Rothschilds have the finest shooting estate in
France, at Vaux-de-Cernay. Kings and princes from
all quarters of Europe have shot the birds of the famous
banker, who is a power behind many thrones, and some
of the fêtes that have followed great hunts in the Rothschild
coverts have been memorable ones. Four thousand
pheasants were slaughtered to make a holiday for
the last royal guest, and after the hunt came an evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of dazzling fête and spectacular illumination of all the
country round.</p>

<p>There are other estates where the chasses à tir are
famous and where sumptuous entertaining is done
during shooting season; but it is in the chasse à cour that
France lives up to its old traditions and can show the
disdainful Englishman sport not known on the English
country side.</p>

<p class="b1">The area of the French hunting districts is comparatively
small, for over half of the hounds of France are
found in Vendee, Anjou, Touraine, and Poitou, but the
packs are many and admirable and the sport is good.
In the remote regions there is boar hunting, that for an
exciting run and a dangerous finish beats anything
England has to offer. The Frenchman will go far for
a boar hunt, but he will not take many of his favourite
hounds with him. English foxhounds are cheaper and the
boar is sure to make short work of any dog that runs in
on him when he stands at bay, bristles erect, little eyes
red with rage, foam flying from his champing tusks;
so, as a rule, the French dog is used only to locate the
boar, and English dogs are offered up, if sacrifice there
must be.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">For wolf hunting the French hounds are called into
service, though it is difficult to break any hound to wolf
scent, and nothing wears a dog out more effectually than
a wolf chase. Good horses are required, too, for a
wolf hunt is likely to mean a night out and a tremendous
straight-away run over a wide area, and even when
dogs and horses and hunters are of the best, an old
wolf will usually give them all the slip. The beast has
phenomenal endurance and cunning. For hours he will
idle along just in front of the hounds, knowing they
dare not attack him while he is fresh. Then, when the
pack is beginning to breathe hard and labour a little,
Monsieur <i>le loup</i> shows what he can do in the way of
speed when he really gives his mind to it. Away he
flies, a streak of yellow grey, leaving his pursuers far
behind, and the chances are that pack and hunters have
but a magnificent run for their pains. One of the most
famous sportsmen of France, who keeps a pack devoted
altogether to wolf hunting, says that he has killed less
than a half dozen old wolves in his hunting career.</p>

<p>Louveteaux&mdash;young wolves&mdash;furnish most of the
sport, and here the story is a different one; for the year-old
wolf provides a long and brilliant but usually successful
run, and frequently a kill in the night when
flaming torches held by huntsmen in picturesque livery
throw weird lights and shadows over the scene.</p>

<p>Small wonder that the Frenchman who chases wolf
and boar returns the Briton's scorn in kind, and calls
the English fox hunt a "promenade à cheval." There
is a certain amount of justice in the phrase, for the
Englishman of fox-hunting fame hunts to ride instead
of riding to hunt.</p>

<p>The French sportsman shrugs his shoulders, too, at the
stag hunt of old England.</p>

<p>"To bring a tame deer in a box and push it under the
noses of the hounds&mdash;Ce n'est pas la chasse, mon ami,"
says the Marquis, with fine contempt, and while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
description doesn't apply accurately to all English deer
hunting, it is true that tracking the deer comes nearer
deserving its title of royal sport in France than in
England.</p>

<p>Contrary to <i>Punch</i> tradition, the gentleman of France
is usually a good shot. Shooting has been an essential
part of his education and even the veriest dandy of
Paris may be uncommonly handy with a revolver or
gun. Such prowess is a part of the traditions of his
race. Duelling was a passion and a diversion with his
ancestors; and while serious duelling is, even in France,
a trifle obsolete to-day, the customs due to it still exist.
Monsieur le Marquis fences cleverly and shoots as well.
Possibly he has his private shooting-gallery and practices
there for a while each morning; but, whether or
no he has this private practice, he is fairly sure to turn
up at some one of the public shooting rendezvous during
the day. The Tir au Pigeon Club in the Bois is the
nucleus from which all of the open-air clubs of Paris
have developed, and is one of the most popular rendezvous
for the smart Parisian set. The same is true at Deauville,
at Nice, and wherever fashionable Parisian colonies
are to be found, and the events at the exclusive shooting
clubs in these places will always bring together a notable
collection of society folk and an impressive exhibit of
Parisian chiffons.</p>

<p>There are many Frenchwomen who can hold their
own with the men when it comes to the handling of a
gun, and a few who can follow hounds as pluckily as
any English Diana; while, as for the wearing of charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
shooting costumes, for the covert, or for luncheon with
the guns, of dressing effectively for the meet, of donning
exquisite negligées for the tea hour when the huntsmen
may be expected to straggle in, tired, valiant, and
loquacious,&mdash;there the Parisienne leads the world.
The tea gowns and shooting costumes of the Place
Vendôme and the Rue de la Paix are the true triumphs
of the French hunting season and the wearing of them
is to the average château guest a thing much more
important than the killing of game&mdash;is, in fact, her
method of following the chase. Nimrod may enjoy
having his adored one by his side in the covert or running
neck and neck with him behind the hounds, but he has
little time for admiring her then. His heart is with
pheasant or hare or deer. The story is a different one
when he goes back to the château in the gathering
twilight and finds daintily gowned women waiting, in
the glow of fire and candle-light, to greet him with
enthusiasm and listen with rapt attention while he
fights his battles over again. Then is the hour of the
sportswoman, for there's more truth than fiction in the
theory so audaciously exploited in "Man and Superman."
The form of the chase which appeals most keenly to
women the world over is the pursuit of man, and the
Parisienne in particular is a zealous devotee of the sport.</p>

<p>A Frenchwoman famous for her advanced ideas,&mdash;the
"new woman" translated into French&mdash;went to
Berlin some years ago, and a conference of the emancipated
was called to do her honour. She came into the
audience hall, exquisitely gowned, the most delightfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
feminine of figures. She looked aghast at the band of
strong-minded, atrociously dressed women assembled to
hear her; and then, throwing aside her premeditated
address upon woman's suffrage, she plunged into an
eloquent plea for the union of becoming dress and
emancipated womanhood, winding up with a fervent
appeal to her sisters to remember always that they
must dress to please the men.</p>

<p>There spoke the true Frenchwoman, new or old; and
the fair guests at the châteaux, whatever may be their
feeling about the chase of stag or the shooting of birds,
never are so lacking in sporting spirit that they neglect
dressing to please the men.</p>

<p>For the Parisienne in general the hunting season
means only an excuse for châteaux visits, and a château
visit means only picturesque meets at which one may
wear one's smartest morning frock, chat with friends
from other châteaux, flirt with gallant huntsmen, and,
perhaps, follow the hunt at a discreet distance in cart
or automobile; it means luncheon with the guns in
English fashion, and another opportunity for a smart
costume; it means the tea hour of coquetry and chiffons;
it means superb dinners to which come fashionable folk
from the country round about; it means evening festivities
of all kinds. Oh, an excellent opportunity for the
displaying of one's wardrobe resources, is the château
visit, and a super-excellent opportunity for <i>les affaires de
c&oelig;ur</i> is offered by the informal intimacy of a great
house party.</p>

<p>The pretentiousness of château entertainment depends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of course, upon the financial condition of the owner, and
it is at the country places of the rich bourgeois, rather
than in the most famous historic houses of France, that
money is spent most freely during the château season,
though American millions have made some aristocratic
house parties famous for prodigal extravagance.</p>

<p>Where money need not stand in the way, the programme
of entertainment is often a costly one. Perhaps, as has
happened before now, theatricals are the order of the
day, and the entire company of one of the Parisian
theatres is brought down from Paris for the occasion.
Or a costume ball is on the tapis and the great dressmakers
of the Rue de la Paix are called upon for dazzling
costumes. Or a popular diseuse or chanteuse or dancer
may be lured away from her café chantant for the
evening in order to enliven the lovers of nature who
have fled to sylvan haunts.</p>

<p>And always one can play bridge. Ye gods, how they
play bridge during the autumn days and nights, those
transplanted Parisians!</p>

<p>All through the long days when the men are off after
bird or deer, the women, arrayed in the daintiest of
bridge coats or frocks, sit around the card tables playing
for stakes that are not always low; and indeed there are
many days when even the men themselves forsake the
coverts for the card tables. During the last château
season, rumours ran concerning eighteen-hour sessions of
bridge when mesdames and messieurs did not lay down
their cards save for hasty luncheon and dinner. Stories
were told, too, of immense losses sustained by guests at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
several famous houses, and games at a louis a point
have ceased to be rare in the fashionable Parisian set.
Some devotees of the game have, it is said, even installed
little bridge tables in the salons of their loges at the
opera and spirited games are played there in the intervals
of the music, or to the neglect of the music.</p>

<p>There are fashionable hostesses who deplore the craze,
but the chief accusation brought against the game
is characteristically French. One hears little protest
against the ethics of bridge, but it appears that the new
fad is killing conversation. If this is true, say the
critics, something must indeed be done to save France.
Conversation is, with the French, a religion, a heritage,
an acquirement, an art, and this fine product of the
centuries must not be allowed to perish in an epidemic
of gambling.</p>

<p>Even after a night spent at bridge, at least a large
percentage of the château party is up and off to the
meet in the grey of the morning. Madame may, perhaps,
sleep later on, but the meet is an occasion, a social
function, a golden opportunity for coquetry; and even if
one does not expect to follow the hounds one must be
in evidence at the reunion. So my lady is up betimes
and at work upon her toilette, a toilette to the planning
of which she has devoted anxious hours before leaving
Paris. One must be très chic at the meet, for les messieurs
will be out in force and the sporting scene with
its forest setting will admit of a touch of audacity in
dress.</p>

<p>Even the true sportswoman of France does not forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to be coquette, and her interest in habit or shooting
costume does not interfere with her sporting zeal. There
are Frenchwomen who go boar hunting and wolf hunting
with their husbands. Others, like the Baronne de
Brandt or the Marquise de Bois-Hebert, visit the out-of-the-way
corners of Europe in search of exciting sport,
and a long list of Parisian society leaders like the Marquise
de Beauvoir, the Comtesse de Fels, the young
Duchesses de Luynes, de Noailles, and d'Uzes, make
excellent records in the home forests.</p>

<p>The name of d'Uzes is important in modern French
hunting annals, though its claims do not rest on modernity.
On the contrary the equipage d'Uzes stands for all
that is traditional and historic in French venery, and the
dowager Duchesse d'Uzes, holding fast to the customs
and traditions of the old régime, keeps up the hunt in
her forests as the Ducs d'Uzes have kept it up through
many a generation and many a change in the affairs of
France.</p>

<p>Sixty thousand acres of the forest of Rambouillet are
leased by the Duchess for her hunting-grounds, and,
though the favourite château of the President of France
lies across the woodland from her own hunting château
of Bonnelles, and his excellency the President of the
French Republic may, if he chooses, shoot birds and
rabbits in the forest, which is the property of the state,
it is the Duchess who reigns in Rambouillet forest and
the republican ruler may not chase the stag there, unless
this great lady of old France graciously extends an
invitation to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>What has Rambouillet to do with presidents and
republics? It has always been the forest of kings, and
its memories reach back through the dim years so far
that modern history can but cling to its fingers, while old
story and romance haunt every bosky depth and sunlit
glade.</p>

<p>It was the heart of the ancient forest of Yveline, this
forest of Rambouillet, the country of the Druids, a place
of mystery and of fable. Cæsar tells how the Gauls
hunted the wild bull in those forest fastnesses. Charlemagne
went a-hunting under the great oaks and beeches,
and by his side rode his empress, Luitgard the beautiful,
while in their train came many a mighty warrior and
prince; came, too, fair princesses whose names alone
are keys to old romance,&mdash;Hiltrud and Rhodaid, Gisela
and Theodrada and Bertha, each in robe of green velvet
and with silken locks floating free from beneath a golden
diadem. For the lover of pictures they still go riding
down the forest aisles, those princesses of the far away,
"swaying the reins with dainty finger-tips" and smiling
on the gallants who rode beside them.</p>

<p>Many a fair lady has ridden in the shades of Rambouillet,
with a courtier at her bridle rein, since Charlemagne's
day. Each king of France in turn has followed
the stag there. Some kings have loved there, some have
died there; some, like Louis XIV, have merely been
bored there; but it was when Louis XIII ruled in France
that venery flourished in its greatest pomp and glory.
Many hundreds of officials belonged to the royal hunting
equipage in the time of this prodigal Louis, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
court followed the king when, with sounding horns and
baying hounds, he coursed through the woods of Rambouillet.</p>

<p>The princes of the blood had their equipages, too, and
there is a story of a long-ago day when three stags broke
cover simultaneously on the sides of St. Hubert's pond,
and behind each streamed a brilliant hunting cortège
sporting the gay colours of a princely house. One can
see them there on the banks of the woodland pool&mdash;the
stags at bay, the swarming hounds, the liveried huntsmen,
the princes and courtiers in gorgeous array, the
background of forest green and the water mirroring the
whole. Extravagant folly, of course, those royal hunts,
but a brave show. Your good republican loves better
to see the president go forth in his tweeds and his slouch
hat, with his guides and beaters and his tweed-clad guests,
to shoot the timid little wood creatures that are driven
into the range of the guns and killed by thousands in the
name of sport. It costs less than Louis' hunting, this
democratic battue, and, to-day, the peasants of France
have bread,&mdash;but for the lover of romance, Rambouillet
is filled with ghosts that make a finer show than the
estimable republican president and his equally estimable
but far from picturesque guests.</p>

<p>Pompous venery went down with all things regal in
the Revolutionary flood, but Napoleon, ever theatrical at
heart, appreciated the dramatic opportunities of the
chase, and once more Rambouillet echoed to the bay of
hounds and the call of horns, while the little great man
rode in Charlemagne's paths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Since then, the career of hunting in France has been
a chequered one. After the revolution of 1848, the
forests were leased to the great nobles, but Napoleon III
had the vast domains confiscated after his coup d'état,
and it was then that the Ducs d'Uzes and de Luynes
held a great final hunt before abandoning the forests to
the usurper, and made a kill that is mentioned with awe
by latter-day hunters.</p>

<p>But Napoleon cared little for the chase, and in 1868
the dukes were hunting again in their old haunts. The
Duc de Luynes died and the Duc d'Uzes took over his
pack. When he, too, went the way of all flesh, his
widow refused to give up the famous hounds and the
traditional equipage. She re-leased the forest, held
tenaciously traditions of the chase as they had been
upheld by a long line of Ducs d'Uzes. While she lives,
at least, the hounds of St. Hubert will occupy their
kennels at La Celle les Bordes, and the red and blue and
gold of the equipage d'Uzes will flash through the leafy
lanes of the forest of Rambouillet.</p>

<p>The Bonnelles season begins on the first of September,
but only intimate friends and zealous sportsmen are
gathered together in the château at the opening of the
season. Later there will be guests of ceremony, royal
visitors, and all of the gay Parisian crowd whom the
family d'Uzes deigns to entertain.</p>

<p>The dowager Duchess, grande dame of the old school,
is mistress of the château, but she has able assistants in
her daughter-in-law, the young Duchesse d'Uzes, and in
her daughters, the great ladies of de Luynes and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Brissac. They fit in oddly with the venerable customs
of Bonnelles, these typical products of a society essentially
modern, but the combination of new and old
is a piquant one, and the excessively up-to-date young
Duchesse d'Uzes never appears to better advantage than
when she kneels in the little church of Bonnelles on
St. Hubert's Day, or, in bravery of blue and scarlet and
gold, follows the hounds of Bonnelles through the forest
of Rambouillet.</p>

<p>The château of Bonnelles is an imposing pile set in a
beautiful park of about two hundred acres, and furnishes
room for many guests. Life goes to the same tune there
as in the other châteaux during the autumn season,
though there is a hint of old-world dignity mingled with
the modern gaiety, and among the guests are often
included interesting figures not familiar in the very
modern salons of Paris. And, too, the hunting is taken
rather more seriously at Bonnelles than at many of the
châteaux, though even there the late season crowd gives
itself over to frivolity rather than to sport.</p>

<p>The kennels of Bonnelles are located at the farm of
La Celle les Bordes, about five miles from the château,
and the old seigneurial farmhouse is used as a hunting-lodge
and a museum for relics and trophies of the chase.</p>

<p>There are packs in France larger than that of Bonnelles.
The Menier family, for instance, has sixty
couples in its kennels which are perhaps the best in
France, while the d'Uzes pack numbers only eighty
hounds all told, and of these only sixty run with the
pack,&mdash;but they are aristocrats, these hounds of d'Uzes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
with pedigrees that might put nine tenths of the mushroom
nobles of France to shame.</p>

<p>The hounds of St. Hubert are the oldest hunting-dogs
of history. Before the time of Charlemagne they were
the hunting comrades of kings, and though the pure St.
Hubert strain has lost caste and the best dogs of the
modern French kennels have been crossed with other
blood, it is the old French aristocrat among hounds that
gives to the famous French packs their long melancholy
faces, their marvellous scent, and their melodious voices.</p>

<p class="b1">The dogs of Vendee, lineal descendants of the dogs of
St. Hubert, were first favourites in the days of Louis XI,
and the d'Uzes hounds trace their lineage back to two
royal dogs of that early time,&mdash;Greffier, one of the
king's most valuable hounds, a white St. Hubert crossed
with mastiff, and Baude, the pet hound of Anne of
France, daughter to the king. Since that far-away day,
the Vendean strain has been crossed with royal English
buckhound to the great advantage of the French hound,
say those who should know, but, despite this alien blood,
it is the descendant of Greffier and Baude that yelps in
the kennels at La Celle les Bordes when the dog valets
put the pack in leash on the morning of St. Hubert's
Day.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">This third of November is a great day at Bonnelles,
for the Duchess is ardent churchwoman and ardent
patron of the chase, and on St. Hubert's Day the two
objects of her devotion fraternize in all pomp and
ceremony. Out from the lodge gates issues the pack,
and with the dogs go the governor of the pack, the two
mounted piqueurs, the two chief foresters, the two chief
dog valets, and the lesser officials&mdash;all of whom make
up the equipage d'Uzes. The huntsmen are in hunting
costume of the d'Uzes colours, with hunting-horns slung
round their necks and hunting-knives in their belts, the
dog valets wear the red and blue without the gold lace,
and the chief dog sports the colours of his owners.</p>

<p>On they go to the little church of Bonnelles where a
crowd is awaiting them. Outside the church there is
a group of onlookers drawn here by curiosity to see the
famous ceremony, but within the doors one finds a
gathering of folk whom one remembers seeing at Longchamps,
on the Avenue des Acacias, in the Casino at
Trouville. The little Duchesse d'Uzes is there, charming
in her habit and in her three-cornered hunting-hat with
its blue and red and gold, but she is very solemn now,
this gay little duchess, very solemn indeed; for, as we
have said elsewhere, she is devôte, and even at the
blessing of the hounds she does not relax her pose.</p>

<p>The piqueurs lead the dogs before the high altar, the
mass of St. Hubert is said, and, as the priests lift the
host on high, suddenly there is a carillon of bells, hunting-horns
sound the fanfare of St. Hubert, the crowd rustles
to its feet. Out of the church file the priests in gorgeous
vestments and the red-robed acolytes bearing the blest
bread of St. Hubert. The oldest priest crumbles the
bread for the dogs, sprinkles holy water over the quivering
muzzles. There is another peal of bells, the horns
sound gaily, the hunting folk spring to saddle, the
guests who are not to hunt climb into their traps and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
automobiles, the piqueurs crack the long lashes of their
dog whips, the hounds strain at their leashes, and the
whole procession wends its way merrily toward the place
chosen for the meet,&mdash;while the outsider privileged to
witness the show rubs his eyes and hurries off to find a
calendar, that he may see whether perchance this is the
year of grace 1905 or an earlier and more ceremonious
time.</p>

<p>The rendezvous for the meet is at some carrefour or
crossroads, where an old stone cross with ancient inscription
usually marks a circular opening in the forest, and
there one may see an amusing sight on any morning
when the hounds are out. Eight o'clock is the rallying
hour, and before that hour, though shreds of night
still cling to the trees and blur the forest roads, the
Duchess is on hand with the party from Bonnelles, to
greet her guests.</p>

<p>Up out of the mist they come, gay parties from the
neighbouring châteaux, officers from the nearest garrisons,
reinforcements from Paris. Some are in hunting
costume, some are driving smart traps, many spin up to
the rendezvous in automobiles and the snorting and
puffing of their machines mixes oddly with the neighing
of horses and the restless whining of the hounds. The
red coats of the huntsmen, the bright colours of the
officers' uniforms, the chic costumes of the women, lend
an aspect of gaiety to the sombre forest setting with its
wreathing grey mist, and there is a chatter of voices, a
ripple of laughter.</p>

<p>The stag which has been tracked and located before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
the place for the meet was appointed is reported still
close at hand, and the master of the hunt gives the
word. The hounds are unleashed and sent forward,
while at the carrefour, the noise dies down to a murmur
or an expectant hush.</p>

<p>Then there is a crash in the thicket, the hounds give
tongue, high, sweet, and clear on the crisp autumn air
the horns sound the "Stag in view," and away goes the
hunt, a glinting line of colour through the dull November
woods. The dogs run close, the hunters ride hard, and
at their head is the little Duchess, reckless, excited,
joying in the sport, true daughter of a hunting house.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand the passion for the chase,
when one rides in the wake of the hounds through the
haunted old forest of the Druids while the horns are
playing the ancient hunting-airs of France and the
hounds' sonorous voices ring full and sweet and sad&mdash;for
there is ever a melancholy in the music when a pack
of St. Huberts is in full cry.</p>

<p>The horses stretch themselves to the chase, the tingling
morning air is full of wood scents, the sun is scattering
the mist.</p>

<p>Hola! Hola! Madame la Duchesse hunts the stag!</p>

<p>The trembling hares and birds seek the thick covert,
but they are safe. No presidential battue this, but
royal sport. Madame la Duchesse hunts the stag in
the ancient forest of kings.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">UNDER SOUTHERN SKIES</p>

<p class="pn p2">For the gambler and the cocotte, the Riviera means
merely Monte Carlo. The gambler is drawn by the
lure of the green tables in the splendid Casino. The
cocotte goes where the money-spending crowd is to be
found, where she may show her frocks and her jewels
and her beauty, where recklessness and extravagance
and excitement are in the air. She gambles, too, carelessly
or cannily, according to her temperament, and she
loves to make a sensation on the terrace, in the Café
de Paris, at Ciro's, or best of all in the Casino, where the
apparition that draws attention from the piles of money
on the green felt must be startling indeed.</p>

<p>Incidentally she acknowledges that there are wonderful
views and dazzling sunshine and invigorating air
outside the brilliantly lighted, over-heated Casino, and
that these things contribute to her enjoyment; but she is
not an ardent nature lover, this Parisienne, and she
would find the Riviera deadly dull without the life that
centres round the gaming tables.</p>

<p>Even the residential element and the smart hotel set
of aristocratic Cannes and Anglo-American Nice, of
Cap Martin and Beaulieu and Cimiez and Mentone, feel
the fascination of M. Blanc's earthly paradise upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Monaco promontory and spend considerable time there
in the course of the season; but for this class the social
season is as important as the gambling, and Monte
Carlo is but a single feature of the Riviera scheme.</p>

<p>It has been said that Cannes, Nice, and Monte Carlo
represent, respectively, the world, the flesh, and the
devil; and the classification is roughly accurate. Cannes
has the most exclusive social life along the coast; its
villas are occupied by folk whose names rank high in
the social blue-books of the European capitals; the
registers of its hotels bristle with sounding titles and its
swell clubs have membership lists calculated to impress
anyone who loves a lord. The Napoule Golf Club at
Cannes has a Russian Grand Duke for president and an
English Duke for vice-president; and, on the links,
counts and barons, belted earls and multi-millionaires,
are thick as leaves in Vallambrosa. Even princes and
potentates drive off the tees and struggle in the bunkers.
One sees rather more of London than of Paris in the
crowd, but there are Parisians, too, and they are even
more English than the English in their sporting proclivities,
for fashion is a more aggressive thing than
nature. The whole atmosphere is English at Napoule.
From the architecture of the picturesque timbered club-house
to the h's of the servants, everything has a fine
British flavour, and save for the frocks of the women and
the fluent Parisian French dividing honours with English
on the links and in the club-house, there is little to remind
the guest that he is in France.</p>

<p>Down in the town, and along the famous Promenade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
de la Croisette, there is a different story. Here, too, a
large percentage of the fashionable crowd is English,
but the setting is French where it is not Italian. The
Croisette, the Promenade des Anglais at Nice, the terrace
at Monte Carlo, are three of the most beautiful,
the most fashionable, the most amusing promenades in
the world, and the idler may spend many profitable hours
upon any one of the three; but each has its distinctive
flavour just as each of the three towns has its own local
colour and its own crowd, though all share alike in the
sparkling beauty of the Riviera summer land.</p>

<p>Yachting is an institution even more important than
golf in the programme of Cannes. The Cercle Nautique,
one of the chief rendezvous for the society set, is
exclusive to the last degree, and out in the beautiful
harbour splendid sea-going yachts from all parts of
Europe and from America are anchored during the
season. Some of the yacht owners prefer living in
hotels or villas during their sojourn and use the boats
for cruising only; but more live aboard their floating
palaces, and there is constant going and coming twixt
yachts and <i>quai</i>, to the immense entertainment of outsiders
who get no nearer than this to the social life at
Cannes. Carriages roll up to the landing and deposit
wonderfully gowned women and men whose names are
whispered knowingly by the watching throng. Launches
are waiting to receive the load of fashion and celebrity.
There is a tableau of coquetry and chiffons, a shuffling
of royal highnesses and wealthy commoners, and the
little boats move off toward the yacht, where luncheon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
will be served on deck under the awnings, to the
accompaniment of tinkling mandolins and guitars.</p>

<p>There are worse things even for royalty than to sit
at a violet-strewn table under awnings that flap in the
soft sea breeze of a sunshiny February day, and, in the
intervals of a luncheon prepared by an artist for an
epicure, to look off across dimpling blue water to a
curving white line of shore where promenaders make
bright impressionistic dashes of colour in the sunlight,
and to the grove-embowered villas, the imposing, many-pillared
hotels, the mediæval little villages that climb
the verdure-clad mountains behind the town.</p>

<p>Cannes is lovely,&mdash;far lovelier than Nice in its
natural scenery, but Cannes is cold to tourists, dull for
those who have not the open sesame to its charmed
social circle. The ordinary visitor will find Nice far
more gay. Here, too, there is an exclusive villa and
hotel set, but it does not dominate the situation as at
Cannes. There is welcome and entertainment for everyone
at Nice. On the Promenade des Anglais stroll men
and women from all countries and all classes, and queer
groups collect at "la potinière," the gossip rendezvous
which ends the promenade. The new town with its
public parks, its fascinating shops, its luxurious hotels
and modest hostelries, its gorgeous restaurants and its
cheap eating-places, its clubs, its gambling, its flower
markets, its tide of restless pleasure seekers, is as gay a
place as the world holds when the Riviera season is at
its height, and though one may live there cheaply or
extravagantly, it would be difficult to live there dully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
unless one were a hardened misanthrope; for all things
woo to pleasant folly, and jollity is in the air.</p>

<p>To stroll from one's hotel to the famous promenade
on a bright morning is to snap one's fingers at carking
care. The sunshine is such fluid gold as no northern
country knows, the air is fresh, intoxicating, full of
warring sea scents and flower perfumes, a sky wonderfully
soft, deeply blue is overhead, the Mediterranean
is a marvellous changing sea of turquoise and sapphire
and amethyst and beryl, with here and there high
golden lights where the sun catches a ripple of foam.
Boys and girls hold out great handfuls of big, long-stemmed
purple violets to you and the fragrance comes
sweet and heavy to your nostrils. Women in light
summer frocks stroll along the broad white walk, stopping
to chat with friends; on the roadway which the
promenade borders, roll luxurious private carriages,
smart dog-carts, hired fiacres, hotel wagons, all loaded
with smiling folk, for one smiles perforce in this world
of sunshine and flowers and laughter.</p>

<p class="b1">On the inland side of the roadway is a line of hotels
and villas and cafés and shops, with tropical gardens
breaking the line of gleaming white buildings; and in
those shops one may find the best that European
merchants have to offer to extravagant womankind;
for the famous jewellers and milliners and dressmakers
of Paris, London, and Vienna have branch establishments
here, and the proprietors of the great houses
often spend the season in villas at Nice or Monte
Carlo and oversee in person their lively Riviera trade.</p>

<p class="p1">Paquin, Beer, Doeuillet, and their peers are familiar
figures at Nice and Monte Carlo; and these mighty
ones of the fashion world may well feel, with a glow
of satisfaction, that they are responsible for much of
the glittering show that passes in review under their
critical eyes.</p>

<p>Nice is not given over wholly to fresh air and
promenading.</p>

<p>Down in the Casino of the jetty, a pavilion of many
minarets which opens off from the promenade and
under whose foundations the sea washes listlessly, there
is gambling&mdash;trente et quarante, roulette, and, in the
more exclusive club-rooms to which one is admitted
only by card, baccarat; but gambling is an incident at
Nice. All things save gambling are incidental at Monte
Carlo, and while a host of folk live in Nice without playing
at the jetty Casino or the municipal Casino, but few visitors
to Monte Carlo resist the fascination of the gaming
tables. There is always a crowd at the jetty Casino
after luncheon, lounging, gossiping, gaming, listening to
the excellent orchestra; and the crowd about the gambling
tables is the mixed and motley crowd one always
finds in such a situation, but there are fewer smart folk
at the trente et quarante and roulette tables than one
sees at corresponding tables in Monte Carlo. The
fashionables of Nice choose the baccarat club-rooms for
their rendezvous, and it is there that you must go to
see modish women and well-known men gossiping,
flirting, and playing high.</p>

<p>There is a popular restaurant adjoining the gambling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
rooms,&mdash;a gorgeous restaurant, brilliant with scarlet
lacquer and Chinese decorations, though chop suey is
not on the menu,&mdash;and many of the baccarat players
dine or sup there; but there are so many places in which
to lunch or dine or sup in Nice that one may find a
meal to suit any palate, and a price to suit any purse.</p>

<p>The Helder has the same proprietor as Armenonville
and the Café de Paris, and much the same crowd.
The Regence is the Helder's great rival, and after these
comes a long line of town restaurants, each with its
individual claim upon the diner's attention, while out
on the hills and all along the coast are famous hotel
restaurants and cafés to which the gay Nicois resort.</p>

<p>There is tea-drinking, too, and the places where
women flock at the tea hour are many, but while my
lady of aristocratic Cannes is likely to drink her tea at
the Cercle Nautique or in some other exclusive haunt,
Madame of Nice frequents tea-rooms such as those of
Paris; and tea hour at a place like Vogades offers an
interesting study in femininity, though the crowd is
frightfully mixed and, sometimes, unconscionably gay.</p>

<p>It is during carnival time that gaiety becomes a trifle
furious at Vogades. The regular winter visitors and
residents of Nice frown upon King Carnival and dread
his advent; but for the transient visitor the show is an
amusing one and the common folk of Nice throw themselves
into the celebration with a gay abandon that
sometimes approaches objectionable license. Who cares
whether a few fastidious critics are holding aloof from
carnival gaieties when ninety per cent of the motley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
populace of Nice is eating, drinking, dancing, and making
merry, when fun and folly are running riot, when all
the town is ablaze with garlands of electric lights and
artificial flowers, when confetti is raining through the
air and grotesque figures fill the streets.</p>

<p>Vulgar, of course. All carnivals are vulgar and the
line between mirth and horse-play is easily crossed, but
it is a pity not to see the carnival at Nice at least once,
and not to enter into the spirit of the thing, without a
handicap of aristocratic prejudices. The age of spontaneous
mummery is past and carnival foolery has a
strained and artificial note in this self-conscious day,
but one may be merry in Nice when King Carnival sits
enthroned and a multitude, hiding its irresponsibility
behind masks, gives itself up to folly.</p>

<p>All through the season there are fêtes in Nice. The
Battle of Flowers is more like the real thing than is the
Parisian imitation; the Corso Automobile Fleuri brings
out a brave array of flower-decorated automobiles; the
children's flower fête is the prettiest thing of its kind in
Europe; and there is a water fête in the bay of Villefranche,
where flower-decorated boats and floats loaded
with musicians and merry-makers swarm on the blue
water, and flower battles rage amid music and laughter
and the murmur of the waves. Grim war-vessels are
usually lying in the harbour and the revellers row out to
pelt the monsters derisively with flowers and jests, and
to aim violet bunches impartially at the cannon's mouth
and the ranking officer's head.</p>

<p>Yes, Nice is gay,&mdash;absurdly gay; and if, at its gayest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
it is not smart, still one will see the loveliest of Parisian
toilettes in the restaurants and the Casino, and on the
promenade.</p>

<p>There are lovely villas in Nice, hidden away, even in
the more crowded parts of the town, among palms and
aloes and banana trees and eucalyptus, and gay with
yellow mimosa and other flowering things while behind the
town on the hillsides are villas lovelier still, gleaming
white amid groves of orange and lemon trees and tropical
vegetation, and overlooking shore and sea. Wherever
there is space for them flowers grow, and every
breath of air is sweet-scented. In the distance, beyond
the grey-green slopes where the olives thrive, are misty,
snow-capped mountains, and far away along the coast
stretches the white thread of the Corniche road, that
road of marvellous views and picturesque surprises,
which is the heart's delight of the motor maniacs on the
Riviera.</p>

<p>Motoring is a passion with the Riviera crowd as with
every holiday crowd to-day, and though many of the
roads are too steep and narrow and rugged for motors,
or even for comfortable driving, the few that are practicable
are beautiful enough not to grow monotonous.
From one resort to another, all along the coast, the
automobiles go scudding, and even the steep hills of
Monte Carlo swarm with puffing cars. A little danger
more or less makes small impression upon the Monte
Carlo crowd. Skidding recklessly down hill is, figuratively
speaking, the metier of so many of the throng that
haunts the Casino and fills the great hotels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Life at Monte Carlo is essentially sensational. A
continual whirl of excitement seems to be the ideal of
the habitué, and the class that centres there spends
money recklessly, without reserve and without calculation.
There are gamblers who haven't the money to
spend; but they live cheaply at some one of the nearby
resorts, where they may lose themselves between Casino
hours, and in the little town of fine hotels and cafés and
shops which clings to the skirts of the Casino, life goes
to a merry tune. Perhaps the unwholesome fever of
the gaming rooms infects the district; but, whatever the
cause, Monte Carlo sees little of the sanely joyous life
that may be found at other Riviera resorts. Everything
is brilliant, luxurious, dramatic, but of restfulness and
simple pleasure the beautiful spot knows nothing,
and though, for a few days, even the fastidious traveller
may be well amused there, for a longer stay it is wise
to go outside of the miasmic circle.</p>

<p>The incongruity between drama and setting is one of the
most striking things about the place, though familiarity
dulls the first swift impression of the contrast. If ever
man diverted God-given beauty to the devil's uses, he has
done it there upon the Monaco shore, and the serpent
was no more out of place in Paradise than is a gambling
Casino on that picturesque promontory overlooking the
Mediterranean&mdash;but the daughters of Eve have smiled
upon the Casino as their ancestors smiled upon the
serpent, and though their gambling has been for smaller
stakes than hers, they have made a somewhat spectacular
record of their own. The feminine element at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
Monte Carlo is one of the most characteristic and
dramatic features of the resort. Nowhere else in the
world will one see women of all classes gambling openly
and heavily; nowhere else are the alpha and omega of
feminine folly so sharply and obviously contrasted&mdash;and
so gaily and recklessly ignored. Around the tables,
from opening until closing hour, crowd women derelicts;
each train that stops at the station below the
wonderful terraces brings more. The veriest ingénue
might read the stories of wreck and disaster, yet the
warning makes not the faintest impression upon the fair
feminine craft steering head on toward the rocks.</p>

<p>How can Fifi of the wonderful frocks and jewels
guess that she will lose once too often at the little
green tables, that the day of adorers ready and eager
to pay her losses will pass, that youth and beauty
will make way for such shrivelled and haggard age as
that of the painted and bedizened harpies who haunt
the gaming rooms, staking their few francs and watching
for opportunities of making way with the stakes
of other players.</p>

<p>For the average casual visitor to Monte Carlo, these
hags of the Casino are among the sharpest and cleanest
cut of first impressions. Later one grows used to them,
ignores them, allows them to take their places in the
shifting human panorama that is in its way as fascinating
as the roulette and trente et quarante which brings the
crowd together; but at first these hideous old women of
the furrowed faces plastered with rouge, of the furtive
eyes, of the loose lips, the trembling claw-like hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the dirty laces, the false jewels, have a hateful fascination,
obscure all other impressions.</p>

<p>There are many of the harpies living entirely by
fraud, and though croupiers, detectives, and attendants
know some of them and suspect others, it seems impossible
to keep them out of the Casino. Occasionally the
doors are barred to someone, but under the present
administration admission rules are more lax than they
were in the old days, and the whole character of the
Casino crowd, while perhaps not more vicious, is certainly
more vulgar than it was under M. Blanc's régime.</p>

<p>The system of the women thieves is a simple one.
An excited crowd surrounds a roulette table; many of
the players know comparatively little about the game.
The stakes are placed, money is lost or won, and raked
in or distributed, in less time than is required for the
telling of it. While a novice hesitates, wondering whether
the money on a certain number is really hers, a yellow
hand reaches across her shoulder and snatches the
stakes. Even if the victim is sure that she knows the
offender, she hesitates to make a scene, to be implicated
in a gaming-room scandal, and the thief audaciously
counts upon this immunity. Sometimes, however, an
attendant sees the transaction and lays a firm hand upon
the old woman's arm before she can get away. Or
perhaps the croupier of the immobile face and the eyes
that see all things notices the hand closing upon money
to which it has no right and brings his rake down sharply
upon the thin wrist in time to stop the move.</p>

<p>There are other wrinkled and haggard old women in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the Casino crowd,&mdash;women less contemptible, more
pitiable, but unpleasant sights for all that. They come
to the gambling rooms to play, not to steal; but the
gambling fever has burned out all that was pure womanly
in them and nothing is left to them in life save the
vice they hug to their hearts. Some of them have been
playing there ever since the first years of the Casino,
missing never a day from the opening to the closing of
the season, and usually staying all day long in the hot,
ill-ventilated rooms. They have but little money and
they play cautiously, watching the run of the game,
making innumerable notes in little note-books, taking
no great risks.</p>

<p>One Russian princess is among the number. Old
habitués of the Casino say that when she came there
first, twenty-five years ago, she was beautiful, superbly
gowned, magnificently bejewelled, but gaming is in the
Russian blood and the princess was a born gambler.
She squandered her fortune, pawned her jewels, sank
lower and lower in the gambling mire, gave herself up
more and more unreservedly to her absorbing passion.
To-day, she lives in a cheap pension at Mentone and
belongs to the class known in Monte Carlo as "the
bread-winners,"&mdash;a class of gamblers making a regular
daily visit to the Casino, playing until perhaps ten,
fifteen, or fifty francs ahead of the bank, and then leaving.
If one is content with making a mere daily pittance out
of the tables, the thing can be surely and systematically
done; and, every morning the first train brings an army of
these bread-winners, together with hundreds of bolder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
gamblers. There is always a crowd waiting at the
Casino doors when they are opened, always a wild
scramble for the chairs around the tables; and, once
comfortably seated, these early comers are usually good
for the day, or at least until dinner-time. They are the
most economical and persistent, though not the most
profitable, of the Casino's patrons.</p>

<p>Fashionable folk favour shorter gambling hours. If
Madame is staying at one of the Monte Carlo hotels,&mdash;at
the famous Hôtel de Paris, let us say, a hotel beloved
of Parisian demi-mondaines and their satellites, but
patronized by cosmopolitan great folk as well,&mdash;she
arises very late and has her breakfast on a terrace with
a sunlit sapphire sea stretching out before her and an
awning sheltering her from the too ardent sun. The
chances are that it is a delectable breakfast, for there is
good cooking in Monte Carlo. The prodigal crowd
that spends its money there demands high living, and the
Café de Paris, with its Indian interior and its famous
grill-room, has seen gay dinners and suppers in its time
and has appropriated a generous share of the winnings
of lucky gamblers, beside helping the Casino to rid the
unlucky player of his money.</p>

<p>Ciro's, too, has played its part in nineteenth-century
romance and scandal and had its share in the Monte
Carlo harvest. The proprietor, an energetic and diplomatic
Italian, has made a large fortune and deserves it,
for he can produce for his cosmopolitan patrons on
demand any dish from buckwheat cakes to the most
delicate frittura, and any drink from vodka to Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
apple-jack. Perhaps that is stating the case too strongly,
but he is a remarkable restaurateur, this Ciro.</p>

<p>These are but two restaurants of the many; and if one
tires of the town, there is the mountain restaurant at
la Turbie, to which one climbs by a funicular and where
the air is keen and cool from the snowy mountain peaks.
Even the view alone is worth the trip to la Turbie;
for, from the restaurant terrace, one looks down upon
Monaco with its palace and cathedral, upon Monte
Carlo with its snowy villas and Casino amid their
groves and gardens, and upon miles of summer sea.</p>

<p class="b1">When déjeuner is ended there are many ways of passing
what is left of the day. The terrace is thronged during the
late morning hours, and if one has breakfasted early
enough there is time for a stroll there&mdash;a stroll that calls
for a smart costume, if one makes pretence of being
truly chic. Up and down the beautiful promenade
saunter the idlers&mdash;a crowd as interesting and as mixed
as that of the promenade des Anglais or the promenade
at Trouville. Past they file, rosy-cheeked, middle-class
Englishwomen in ill-fitting frocks, consummately modish
Parisiennes, notorious in Monte Carlo as at home, fat
German Jewesses, American girls chaperoning their
tired and patient parents, French, American, and English
actresses, great ladies from all countries, men of
every type, from hard-faced chevalier d'industrie to
reigning monarch, from gilded youth to elderly roué.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">One sees many a new fashion note on the Monte
Carlo terrace, and, later, costumes still more chic are in
evidence at the Casino concert, to which come music
lovers from all the neighbouring resorts, for the Monte
Carlo orchestra is one of the best in Europe and even
moralists who have serious scruples to forbid their
gambling do not hesitate to take advantage of the concerts
provided by the profits of the tables.</p>

<p>For the sporting contingent there is driving and
motoring during the early afternoon, before the chill
creeps into the air; and on the terrace overlooking the
grounds of the International Pigeon Shooting Club
there is always a crowd watching the shooting below.
Butchery rather than sport, this pigeon shooting, but
the Monte Carlo club is the most famous in the world
and draws the crack shots from all countries. Betting
runs high among the sportsmen and the onlookers, and
the club events are a great source of entertainment to
those who have heart and stomach for such sport.</p>

<p>After the tea hour, the Casino begins to fill with the
crowd that is its mainstay, the high-playing, heavily
plunging, extravagant crowd, willing to buy excitement
at any price, and some of the heaviest gambling is done
in those hours just before the dinner. The hush grows
more pronounced, more oppressive, and the croupier's
monotonous voice sounds more clearly in its maddening
iteration, "Messieurs, Mesdames, faites vos jeux.&mdash;Les
jeux sont faits. Rien ne va plus."</p>

<p>Every seat at the tables is filled, crowds are clustering
behind the chairs, leaning forward to play, watching
with excitement an unusual run of good or bad luck,
but quiet, intent, absorbed. There is never noise and
confusion, never an outbreak that can create scandal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
A battalion of official employees attends to that, and
quickly, effectually suppresses any objectionable scene.</p>

<p>Monsieur François Blanc, who was responsible for
Monte Carlo, was fond of saying that he had made and
kept the place "absolutely respectable." He is dead
now, this M. Blanc, but before he died he built a
cathedral not far from his Casino, and in a mortuary
chapel of the cathedral reposes the old Prince of Monaco,
who granted to M. Blanc the rights that made Monte
Carlo possible.</p>

<p>The scoffer smiles at that cathedral; and yet M.
Blanc offered it to le bon Dieu in all sincerity. He was
a quiet, unpretentious little man, devoted to his family,
charitable, abstemious in his habits, playing no game
save billiards, gambling not at all, a good man so far as
personal life went, and without scruples concerning his
gambling paradise. He insisted rigidly that play at
Monte Carlo should be under absolutely fair conditions.
As for running a great gambling establishment&mdash;it was
a business like another. He was not ashamed of his
metier and allowed no threats nor pleas nor argument to
disturb him. Men and women would gamble.&mdash;Eh
bien, here was a beautiful place in which they might
indulge their propensity without fear of dishonest treatment.
If they ruined themselves, if they committed
suicide,&mdash;that was their affair. They would have done
the same thing elsewhere and he would have preferred
their doing it elsewhere, for suicides and scenes interfered
somewhat with prosperous business. A host of
detectives and attendants was employed by M. Blanc to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
prevent suicide or hush it up if it occurred, and an
official department was established for the purpose of
furnishing unlucky patrons of the Casino with money
enough to betake themselves elsewhere. Ruined gamblers
were eloquently urged not to die upon the premises.
Railroad tickets and certain sums of money were supplied
to worthy applicants to whose hard luck and
financial collapse officials of the gambling rooms could
testify. The system was not, however, purely charitable,&mdash;M.
Blanc did not believe in pauperizing the poor.
An I. O. U. was accepted in exchange for funds supplied,
and it was understood that this note must be met before
the holder could ever again be admitted to the Casino.
Some time ago statistics showed that forty thousand
pounds had been distributed by this department of ways
and means&mdash;but that thirty thousand pounds had been
repaid. From which one may argue a large proportion
of human integrity or of gambling mania, as one is
optimist or cynic.</p>

<p>M. Blanc had made his fortune in administering the
gambling affairs of Homburg and Baden Baden. When
Germany shut down upon gambling he looked about
for a place in which he could establish a gambling resort
without fear of interference from a paternal government,
and his shrewd eye fell upon the little principality of
Monaco. His Royal Highness the Prince of Monaco,
who was absolute ruler of this little kingdom three and a
half miles long by one mile wide, came of an illustrious
line of gentlemanly pirates, and since piracy
had fallen from favour in the Mediterranean, his revenues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
were not so princely as his title and palace. He was
pleased to make over his piratical rights to M. Blanc in
consideration of an annual subsidy which gave him an
income really royal. Incidentally the Frenchman agreed
to attend to the municipal affairs of the province, to free
the subjects of the Prince from all taxation, and to
guarantee that no one of them should be allowed to
enter the Casino. An excellent bargain from a material
view-point the old Prince made. His successor, Albert I,
the scholarly scientist and Prince who now lives in the
ancient palace of the Grimaldis, where the little town
of Monaco huddles on its isolated rock, facing the
Monte Carlo fairyland across the port of Condamine, has
scruples concerning the source of his income, it is said,
but the Monte Carlo lease, which is held by a syndicate
since M. Blanc's death, has until 1913 to run. Then we
shall see what we shall see. The Prince, who is a
French nobleman, has French revenues which would
keep him from penury, and he is a man of simple tastes;
but it would be a sacrifice for a saint to give up a royal
fortune for a scruple, and one can hardly expect a worldly
monarch to court canonization in such fashion.</p>

<p>Once in possession of his promontory, M. Blanc proceeded
to spend a fortune upon it. A gambling enterprise
had already been tried there but had failed, partly
through mismanagement, partly because the place was
inaccessible, visitors being obliged to arrive by water
and be taken ashore in small boats.</p>

<p>The natural location was, however, beautiful beyond
description, and M. Blanc had the genius to appreciate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
his opportunity. The architect of the Paris Opera
House was called into consultation and a five-million-dollar
Casino was built. Everything that art and money
could do to make the gambling rooms, the corridors, the
concert hall, the theatre, luxurious and beautiful was
done. Splendid terraces, gardens, fountains, were added;
a great reading-room was supplied with the most complete
collection of periodical literature in the world; the
finest of classical concerts were given in the concert-hall;
the best artists of Paris were engaged to present the
latest and most successful Parisian plays in the little
jewel of a theatre; capitalists were induced to build a
railroad to the place and a big elevator was constructed
to carry up from the trains all who did not care to
climb the terraces; a luxurious café was installed in
the Casino grounds.</p>

<p>M. Blanc was a frugal man, but he could scatter
money like chaff for a purpose, and he fulfilled his purpose.
The fame of Monte Carlo spread far and wide.
Visitors flocked there from all over the world, and the
time was short indeed before the originator s money had
returned to him with interest many times compounded.
To-day, after the income of the Prince is handed over
to him, after the taxes of the principality are settled, after
the immense staff of official employees, the musicians, the
artists, are paid, after the repairs and running expenses
have been provided for, the stockholders divide an annual
profit of from two million to two million five hundred
thousand dollars. A profitable business, as M. Blanc
foresaw when he made his investment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The syndicate which now holds the lease and manages
the palace follows as far as possible the system of M.
Blanc, but the body has not the old manager's genius
for doing the wrong thing in exactly the right way, and
the place was not what it once was. M. Blanc had
made the Casino a club and so retained the right to
bar or eject whom he would. In the old days the age
limit was strictly observed. Now one sees mere boys
and girls at the tables. For a long time a frock coat and
high hat in the daytime, and evening dress after six, were
de rigeur, and women's toilettes were carefully considered.
Lord Salisbury and his wife were once refused
admission at the door because the Premier wore a
shabby old felt hat and tweeds, and a celebrated actress
who once appeared in a highly æsthetic costume was
told she could enter after going home and changing
her déshabillé.</p>

<p>To-day, everything from dress clothes to bicycle costume
is permissible in the Casino, though a careful
toilet is the rule, and a host of very shabby and disreputable
gamblers mingles with the more aristocratic
set. The crowd is more sordid, more vulgar, less chic
than of old. Fewer high-class English and French
patronize the tables, and the German Jews who have
taken their places have not improved the general tone of
the throng.</p>

<p>But all this the ordinary visitor does not know, and
even now the place is as fascinating as it is unwholesome.</p>

<p>In the evening come the most brilliant and spectacular
hours of the Casino day. Then one sees the exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
frocks, the superb jewels, the celebrities of good and
ill repute. The women wear elaborate evening dress,
usually topped by a picture hat, and though many
mondaines avoid conspicuous Casino toilettes, the demi-mondaines
vie with each other in gorgeousness of attire.</p>

<p>Some of these rivalries have afforded tremendous entertainment
for onlookers who appreciated the moves in
the feminine game. Liane de Pougy and la belle Otero,
for example, have contributed largely to the Monte Carlo
amusement programme during recent years. Deadly
rivals these two, who fought their battles wherever they
went in Fashion's train, in Paris, at Trouville, at Monte
Carlo. Both were lionnes of the most formidable type,
leaving a wake of ruin and disaster behind them, devouring
fortunes with Brobdignagian voracity, plunging into
the maddest extravagances. Men raved over their
beauty, though cooler-headed critics insisted that Otero
was only a rather coarse and common Spanish type,
with bold, staring eyes, a cruel, sensuous mouth, and a
good figure, while de Pougy, with her long neck and
cat-in-the-cream expression, deserved no beauty prize.</p>

<p>The toilettes of the two were legion and beggared
description. Their jewels were a proverb.</p>

<p>One night, at the Casino, one of the rivals appeared
wearing all her jewels, and even the maddest gambler
stopped his play to look at her. From head to foot she
was ablaze with precious stones of the finest water,
diamonds, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls,
gleaming on throat and arms and fingers and in her
hair, covering her bodice, fastened upon her skirts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The achievement was the sensation of the season.
Nothing else was spoken of the next day, and triumph
was written large upon the face of the wearer of the
jewels; but she had reckoned without her host. The
Casino was more crowded than usual on the following
evening. Curious folk went to see how one beauty
would carry off her victory and how the other would
accept her defeat. The triumphant one was handsome,
beaming, self-satisfied, but her rival was late in coming
and gossip whispered that something dramatic was to
be expected.</p>

<p>It occurred.</p>

<p>Down the length of the gambling rooms walked the
woman for whom the crowd was waiting. She was
perfectly gowned, but with an exquisite and elaborate
simplicity, with a good taste beyond question. Behind
her came her maid decked in jewels from coiffure to
slipper toe, enjoying her part in the comedy, yet awed
by the fortune she carried with her.</p>

<p>No words were necessary, the most unlettered could
read the retort. Madame also had jewels&mdash;as many
and as fine as those of her rival. If anyone doubted
that fact, let him observe. But as for wearing all
one's jewels at once,&mdash;impossible for a woman of
taste!</p>

<p>The reign of la belle Otero is over. Liane de Pougy's
tenure of favour is very uncertain, but they have furnished
the Riviera with a wealth of gossip in their time. Monte
Carlo would miss their annual duel, were there not
younger favourites, as beautiful and as shameless, to air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
their toilettes and jewels and jealousies in M. Blanc's
"absolutely respectable" rendezvous.</p>

<p>Few women go to Monte Carlo without trying their
luck at the tables, though the fall from grace on the part
of the ordinary tourist may mean only a few francs lost
or won. Starry-eyed young girls, staid matrons with
respectability stamped upon their brows, stern, elderly
spinsters&mdash;all may be seen at the roulette board where
small stakes may be hazarded; but they are the novices,
the transients who are tasting the new experience with
a fearful joy. The seasoned and systematic woman
gambler is another thing. So is the reckless woman who
does not bother about system and risks large sums as
lightly as she waves her fan, and with far less calculation.</p>

<p>Langtry belonged to this last class. In her heyday,
one might see her, charmingly gowned, radiantly beautiful,
twisting up thousand-franc notes and tossing them
on the table to lie wherever they might fall, losing as
carelessly as she won and far more often than she won.</p>

<p>Otero and de Pougy, and many of their guild, are of
the shrewd and canny type, gambling to win, and taking
the game of chance seriously, though worrying little over
losses and throwing away winnings with both hands.
The brilliant jewelry shops and the Mont de Pieté of
Monte Carlo are equally prosperous. The winners buy
jewels, the losers pawn them,&mdash;but, on the whole, it is
the men who gamble heavily. Three fourths of the
women who have money enough to play extravagantly
care more about what they wear to the Casino than
about what they win or lose, would rather win at hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and chiffons than at roulette. Occasionally a woman,
like the old Russian princess, ruins herself dramatically
at Monte Carlo, but more often it is the petty woman
gambler who comes to grief&mdash;the woman who has only
a little money and no resources to draw upon when that
little is swallowed up. Not long ago six little American
chorus girls, who had heard much about the gaiety and
extravagance of Monte Carlo, and had conceived the
idea that between luck at gambling and luck at love a
half-dozen pretty Americans might corner considerable
of the gaiety and of the wherewithal for extravagance,
went down to the Riviera and tried trente et quarante.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, when they were penniless, miserable,
absolutely stranded, without money either to stay or to
go home, Sybil Sanderson heard of their plight and
played good angel for the six homesick, disillusioned,
singed little moths. The flames are cruel at Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p>But it is the man who really supports the Casino, the
man who squanders fortunes at the tables, the man who
evolves infallible systems, who gives himself up utterly
to the gambling, who commits suicide on the terrace, or
breaks the bank.</p>

<p>Suicides are few, and the few are carefully covered up,
concealed. The management even denies that they
occur, but ugly rumours are persistent and many seem
to be backed by facts. Detectives are eternally vigilant
to suppress scandal. They rise from the ground, they
fall from the trees, they follow the lucky winner to his
hotel or train in order to see that he is not waylaid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
murdered or robbed by thugs, as has happened before
now, they shadow desperate losers and prevent ugly
scenes, they instruct the penniless where to find the
benevolent gentleman who is willing to furnish transportation
away from Monte Carlo for the human sponge
that has been squeezed dry.</p>

<p>The bank breakers are even fewer than the suicides.
In the old days, a certain amount of money was allowed
to each table for one day. If the bank lost that amount,
the table went out of commission for the rest of the
session; but now, if a lucky player breaks the bank, it
means only a wait of a few minutes until a new package
of money can be brought from the vaults. When the
money arrives, play goes on.</p>

<p>Charles Wells, an engineer, was the man whose spectacular
winnings inspired the song concerning "the man
who broke the bank at Monte Carlo," but many another
man has done the thing and some of them have repeated
the operation several times. There, for instance, was
Garcia, who broke the bank again and again and was
a nine days' wonder at Monte Carlo. He died a wretched
death in the slums of Paris, that lucky Garcia.</p>

<p>And there was a New York salesman among the bank
breakers. Some of the older New York business men
may remember him, for he was a popular fellow and he
cut a wide swath in Europe. First he broke the bank
at Monte Carlo,&mdash;broke it with fine spirit and éclat and
was the envied hero of the hour. Then he went to
Paris and opened a gambling place that quickly became
famous. Baccarat was the game, and the New Yorker's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
luck held. He could not lose. His name was known
all over Europe. Paris gave him the title of Le Roi
Baccarat, and in the morning papers the latest doings
of the baccarat king were as much a matter of course as
the stock market reports.</p>

<p>Of course the luck changed. It always does. One
day the baccarat king began to lose, and he was as
persistent in losing as he had been in winning. The
close air of the gambling rooms had affected his lungs
and his health went with his money. One of the many
women who had loved him in his brilliant day, took
him, a consumptive pauper, to her lodgings, and gave
him shelter, food, and care, but she had no money to do
more. Finally several of the man's old friends and
business associates in New York heard of his condition
and sent money to bring him home. He came, a dying
man, and a little later the same friends contributed the
money to bury him.</p>

<p>Histories of that sort are common among the men
who have broken the bank at Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>As for the Casino management, it does not lament
when some one breaks the bank. Far from it. Such
a run of luck advertises the fairness of the game and
encourages gamblers. The syndicate is frankly pleased
when anyone wins in spectacular fashion&mdash;or in any
fashion whatsoever, for winning only fans the gambling
fever and in the end it is always the bank that wins.
The old saying launched in M. Blanc's day is true:
"C'est encore rouge qui perd, et encore noir, mais
toujours Blanc qui gagne."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The bank of Monte Carlo is honest as the Bank of
England. No hint of trickery has ever been associated
with it, but outside the Casino there are gambling resorts
of a different character. It is said that more money is
lost at the private gambling clubs of Nice in a night than
at Monte Carlo in a week; and whether or not this is
true, it is certain that more men are ruined in these
outside gambling hells than in the Casino. The game
at the latter place is fair; only cash stakes are allowed;
there is no bar and anyone drunk enough to make a
scene is expelled. At many of the private clubs the
play is dishonest; I. O. U's are accepted; and a
drunken fool may gamble away not only all he has
with him, but all he has elsewhere or ever expects
to have, and more. Not all of the suicides along the
Riviera are due to M. Blanc's gambling palace.</p>

<p>It is difficult to keep away from the subject of the
gambling when one talks of Monte Carlo. A famous
show of frocks and jewels and women is on view there;
the fashions of the coming summer are launched there;
the social game is played with verve and zest there;
But, at a distance, one remembers rather the crowd
around the green tables under the great chandeliers,
the flushed faces, the twitching mouths, the trembling
hands, and the uncanny, oppressive, breathless hush that
follows the croupier's "Rien ne va plus."</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pn center p1 mid">LES AMERICAINES</p>

<p class="pn p2">Many Americans swing round the calendar with the
fashionable Parisiennes. Some of them, having married
into the innermost circles of the French aristocracy,
belong to the most exclusive French set and jealously
guard their privileges, associating little with their own
countrywomen of the American colony, for there is a
world of difference between the Parisian social standing
of the American woman who has married into an aristocratic
French family and the American woman of the
American colony. The latter may be brilliant, popular,
and rich, may entertain extravagantly and live in a
whirl of gaiety; but, as a rule, there are certain Parisian
salons to which she has not the entrée, certain doors
stubbornly closed to her, despite her beauty and wit
and wealth. There are exceptions, of course, but, generally
speaking, the hostess of the American colony does
not have upon her visiting list the names of the greatest
ladies of the French set. Her dinners cost more than
any given in the Faubourg St. Germain, her cotillion
favours are a nine days' Parisian wonder, she draws
round her a wealthy and amusing circle of fellow Americans
and foreigners, but she has not the open sesame
to French doors which other Americans have gained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
marriage,&mdash;paying dearly sometimes for their social
privileges.</p>

<p>The American colony is a shifting, transient thing,
changing continually, yet always the same in its general
character and always an important factor in Parisian life.
Americans living in other parts of Europe drift into
Paris at some seasons to swell this colony, or join the
crowd on the Riviera or on the Normandy coast; and
then there is always the casual visitor, the American who
runs over to Europe for frocks or frivolity, but makes
no pretence of living abroad.</p>

<p>Among this last group are a majority of the smartest
folk of American society, and a number of these passing
visitors are accorded social honours seldom granted to
the resident American in Paris. It is among these
women, too, that the Parisian tradesmen find their most
profitable patrons, and a large percentage of the loveliest
confections turned out by the great dressmakers of Paris
is carried away in the trunks of private American
customers.</p>

<p>It would be hard to overestimate the importance of
the American woman in the Parisian fashion scheme.
She pays out more money to the famous dressmakers
and milliners of Paris than all of their other private
patrons taken together; and, even when she herself is
not of the class that does its shopping in Paris, still she
swells the receipts of Paris tradesfolk, for in order to
satisfy her tastes an army of American buyers goes to
Paris twice a year and carries home French materials,
French models, and French ideas, which will be incorporated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
into the output of all American caterers to
woman's vanity, from the manufacturer of inexpensive,
ready-made frocks to the swellest of New York dressmakers.</p>

<p>In 1893, Worth went to the trouble of looking up
Parisian dress statistics and found that the value of the
material consumed annually in France for women's dress
was two hundred million dollars; that one hundred
million dollars' worth was supplied to the Parisian dressmakers
and that the American share of the whole
amount was more than that of all other countries counted
together. The statistics also showed that fully one half
of the Parisian dressmakers' sales was carried off in
personal luggage,&mdash;which, of course, means private
sales.</p>

<p>All this figuring was done thirteen years ago and at
that time the sales had increased two hundred and fifty
per cent within twenty-five years. Since then the rate
of increase has been even greater. American extravagance
in dress has advanced in great leaps, and M.
Worth's figures would doubtless seem small if compared
with to-day's statistics.</p>

<p>The dressmakers of Paris are, of course, disinclined
to give information concerning the amounts of money
paid to them by their private customers, but they are
willing enough to give estimates without names attached,
and the extravagant expenditures of certain wealthy
Americans are common gossip in the dressmaking circles
of Paris.</p>

<p>The most important single order for dress ever placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in Europe came from an American source, but, for
certain private reasons, it did not find its way to Paris,
and there was weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth,
mixed with the buzzing gossip of the Parisian ateliers
when the facts concerning this famous order leaked
out.</p>

<p>A bride's trousseau was the occasion for the spectacular
outlay, and Drecoll of Vienna was the lucky
dressmaker. Just what the bill amounted to, the firm
has never been indiscreet enough to confess; but well
authenticated reports place the sum at two hundred
thousand dollars, and rumour runs it up to two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The items were enumerated in the order, but carte
blanche was given in every case and all that was demanded
was that each garment should be as nearly
perfect for its purpose as the firm could make it. Life
has nothing better to offer an artist dressmaker than an
opportunity such as this, and the Viennese firm endeavoured
to live up to the situation.</p>

<p>There was, for example, a certain long cloth coat on
the list. It was to be green, of a shade indicated, and it
was to have for trimming six Imperial Russian sable
skins. The skins were to be of the finest quality and
perfectly matched. No limit was set to the price. A
simple matter this, in the estimation of the novice, but
Drecoll knows better. Three of the skins desired were
obtained without trouble, a fourth was secured after
some search, a fifth was found far from Vienna, but the
sixth proved a will-o'-the-wisp. Buyers chased it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
one end of Europe to another. There were plenty of
superb sables, but not one to match perfectly the other
five, and the maker's faith was pledged, his blood was
up. St. Petersburg, Nijni Novgorod, Leipsic, Paris,
London, all the great fur markets knew the hunters of
that sixth skin, and the quarry was finally run to earth
and added to the collar of the unassuming coat provided
for an American bride. Not one person out of a thousand
could have gauged the value of the furs, could have
understood the perfection with which they were matched,
but one can imagine that a dressmaking establishment
does not organize an all-Europe sable hunt for any
small sum.</p>

<p>In that matter of furs, our American women have
become recklessly lavish. Everyone can remember the
time when even the most fashionable of society women
considered one sealskin coat a cherished possession
justifying pride. Now, women of the multi-millionaire
set will buy a twenty-thousand-dollar sable coat as
nonchalantly as though it were a linen duster. One
New York importer who caters largely to the ultra swell
clique went abroad last fall commissioned to buy three
sable coats, two of which were to cost any sum up to
twenty thousand dollars, while the price of the third
might soar to thirty thousand if the buyer should find
what he would consider good value for that sum. There
are several forty-thousand-dollar sable coats in this
country, and sets costing from five thousand to ten
thousand dollars may be counted by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Moreover, the fashionable woman does not content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
herself with one set of furs, but buys them to match her
costumes, as she would buy a veil or a pair of gloves, and
will own perhaps a dozen sets, discarding immediately
any that begin to show wear or are not of the latest cut.
One Western woman bought five fur coats in New York
this season, one a superb affair of sable, one a motor
coat, and the other three fancy short coats trimmed in
lace and embroidery. Now that no one with money
spends a summer in a warm climate, the fashionable
woman's furs are in commission all the year round, and
the American, like the Parisienne, will wear her
sables over a summer frock in August, if she is where
the temperature is chilly. Naturally the wear and tear
is greater than in the old days when furs were carefully
put away during half the year, and the modern élégante's
furs have to be frequently replenished.</p>

<p>My lady's furs are only one item of many included in
her year's wardrobe, and the other items are proportionately
expensive. The heads of establishments counting
among their clientèles the wealthiest women of New
York and of the other important American cities were
consulted in the compiling of the list that follows, and
were asked for conservative estimates of the sums spent
annually for goods in their lines, by a representative
woman of the very smart set. In every case the authority
consulted emphasized the fact that some of our
women spend much more than the sum mentioned, and
that occasionally, for some special reason, a customer
will plunge into phenomenal extravagance.</p>

<p>Here is the list, which is, after all, but a fragmentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
one, for it is hard to estimate upon the thousand and
one little things of dress:</p>

</table>

<p>The reader who has not looked into the matter may
consider this sum total an exaggerated one; but, on the
contrary, it is, while of course only approximate, a very
modest average made up from the figures furnished by
reliable tradesfolk in positions warranting their speaking
authoritatively. Furs, for instance, set down at two
thousand dollars a year, sometimes mount to forty thousand
in one season. Twenty-five hundred dollars may
seem an appalling amount to pay out for lingerie during
the year, but one authority quoted four thousand dollars
and another thirty-five hundred, and both added that
there were New York women who spent even more than
that. At Mademoiselle Corne's place,&mdash;perhaps the
most fashionable of the lingerie establishments of Paris,
an inquirer was shown several trunkfuls of fine lingerie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
ready to be sent to an American customer, and among
the items were sets of three pieces priced at nine hundred
francs (one hundred and eighty dollars), lingerie tea-jackets
at four hundred francs, lingerie petticoats at
three hundred and fifty francs. At that rate twenty-five
hundred dollars will not go so very far, and in this day
of lingerie marvellously embellished with handwork
and real lace, prices mount to surprising heights.</p>

<p>The elaborate negligée is of comparatively recent
acceptance in America, but now the boudoir gown and
tea-gown are considered important by chic Americans,
and five hundred dollars is no unusual price for an
exquisite tea-gown. One New York woman bought
three at that price from a Paris maker last fall, so
fifteen hundred dollars is surely a mild figure for the
year's negligées.</p>

<p>Twenty-five hundred dollars will not begin to pay for
the gloves, silk stockings, parasols, fans, and such little
accessories bought by a woman of the class under
consideration, during a year and no estimate has been
made upon jewels, for there the scale may slide to any
figure.</p>

<p>All this expert testimony as to the extravagance of the
American woman of fashion may vex the souls of the
righteous and lead the philosopher and student of social
economy to gloomy prophecy concerning the future of
American society, but the moralizing may be done elsewhere.
Here is only a statement of facts, and it is
undeniably a fact that the fashionable women of America
spend more upon personal luxuries than any other class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in the world, save only a small group of Parisian demi-mondaines.</p>

<p>It is not only the New York woman who is extravagant,
though since wealth is concentrated there, that city is
the headquarters of the spenders. The spirit has spread
all over our country, and wherever one finds great
American fortunes, there one finds the woman of the
costly frocks and furs and jewels.</p>

<p>The largest single order ever placed with a Parisian
dressmaker was given to Worth by a Chicago woman&mdash;and
an elderly woman, not socially conspicuous despite
her wealth. Twenty-five trunks were used for shipping
the order, and one hundred and forty expensive garments
were packed into the trays. Every city of importance
and a host of the small towns are represented upon the
books of the Paris houses. The City of Mexico has a
clique of society women famous for dress, and the South
American trade is considered very important in Paris.
Dwellers in the States have a "magerful" fashion of
appropriating the term American for their own private
use, and appear to harbour a vague general idea that
south of Palm Beach and Miami a bead necklace is the
accepted costume; but the tradesfolk of Paris know
better. Crowds of wealthy South Americans flock into
Paris each summer and spend money lavishly upon
clothes, jewels, and all the other luxuries of a prodigal
civilization. In all the South American capitals one
finds the woman of the French frock, and Buenos Ayres,
in particular, has a smart set remarkable for the fashion
and extravagance of its women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally it is not only in the province of clothes the
money-spending mania of America asserts itself. Among
Americans of wealth the cost of living has swelled to a
startling figure. Numerous magnificent homes equipped
with every luxury that money can buy, entertainment on
a princely scale, servants by the score, horses, carriages,
automobiles, steam-yachts,&mdash;all these are the necessities
of the multi-millionaire who is in society. The
floral decorations for a dinner or ball often cost thousands
of dollars, and five hundred dollars' worth of
flowers for a small dinner in New York or Newport is
no unusual order. Cotillion favours for a large ball have
been known to cost ten thousand dollars, and thousands
of dollars go to the caterer upon such an occasion.</p>

<p>When the Castellanes, during their social career, spent
forty thousand dollars on one evening's entertainment,
all Paris was agog, but that sum has been far exceeded
for single social functions in New York, and from ten
thousand dollars to twenty thousand dollars is no
surprising cost for a successful ball.</p>

<p>Every year the social standards mount higher, in point
of expenditure, and new methods of getting rid of
money are added to the already long list. The motor,
for example, has added from fifteen thousand to twenty
thousand dollars to the annual expenditure of numerous
wealthy men who have motor mania in its acute form,
buy many superb cars, employ expensive machinists
and chauffeurs, build fine garages, and race their cars.</p>

<p>But all this extraordinary lavishness is confined to a
comparatively small part of our population, affects but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
a little clique of millionaires, and while even in smart
society a large contingent is living beyond its means, a
majority of the most extravagant American money-spenders
have fortunes ample enough to justify their
annual expenditures&mdash;at least from a financial point of
view. It is the increasing extravagance in dress and
luxury among the classes of more moderate incomes
that is most interesting to a social student, and the
American tendency is, proportionately, as marked here
as in wealthier circles.</p>

<p>All along the social line American women are spending
more for dress than ever before. Each year marks a
rise in the grade of goods demanded and sold, and
manufacturers, merchants, and dressmakers all testify
to the remarkable improvement in American standards
of dress during recent years.</p>

<p>The rise of the ready-made frock has had much to do
with bringing about this result, and few outsiders have
any conception of the growth and importance of this
industry. Forty years ago very few models were brought
to this country from Europe, and very few women even
of the wealthiest class knew much about Paris shopping.
As for the woman of humble social position she was
quite out of touch with French fashion. About thirty-eight
years ago, A. T. Stewart launched the first ready-made
frocks, and record has it that they were frights.
Shortly after that there were four small establishments
in the United States manufacturing women's ready-made
garments. To-day there are forty-eight hundred houses
devoted to such business in New York City alone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
some of the largest American dressmaking factories are
in towns outside of New York,&mdash;in Cleveland, Chicago,
Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Everyone of these manufacturers
sends men to Paris at least twice during the
season to buy models, obtain sketches, notes, and ideas.
Even the cheapest of the ready-made costumes to-day
has in it some faint echo of Parisian art, and there are
American manufacturers of ready-made coats and frocks
who make no low-class goods at all.</p>

<p>If one walks into Paquin's establishment and pays
five hundred dollars for a frock, one feels that she is
paying a good price, but there are specialty houses in
New York turning out ready-made models at five hundred
dollars and making nothing for less than one
hundred dollars; and these expensive costumes find
ready sale.</p>

<p>Occasionally a woman retains the old-time prejudice
against ready-made garments and wonders why anyone
will pay two or three hundred dollars for a ready-made
gown. Given a choice between a gown made to order
by Paquin and one at the same price from a New York
manufacturer, it would doubtless be the part of wisdom
to take the Paquin creation; but there is no Paquin in
New York, and though there are some exceedingly good
dressmakers here, there are also many who charge high
prices without the ability to justify them. Many women
who have had disastrous experiences with such makers
claim that, at least, in a ready-made frock one can be
sure of the general effect, and that if it comes from a
good maker, whether French or American, and is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
cut to begin with, it will even after alteration fit better
and do more for one's figure than a made-to-order
gown from incompetent hands.</p>

<p>There are still cheap ready-made garments on the
market, but demand for good materials and fine workmanship
is steadily growing and, through the efforts of
manufacturers to meet this demand, ideas of better
dressing have been spread broadcast.</p>

<p>Fortunes have been made quickly by men who have
kept step with this improvement in taste and supplied
good models of Parisian design and excellent workmanship
for the American ready-made trade.</p>

<p>One manufacturer came to this country twelve years
ago, in the steerage, and went upon a tailor's bench at
fifteen dollars a week. He was a Russian or Polish Jew,
which is equivalent to saying that he belonged to the
greatest money-making race on earth. He saved a little
money, opened workrooms. To-day he has a factory
in which he employs nine hundred men and women, he
lives in a beautiful home on Riverside Drive, he goes to
business in a big automobile, he has done a two-million-dollar
business within the last year&mdash;and all in ready-made
frocks of the better grades.</p>

<p>There is much talk of sweat-shop labour in connection
with women's ready-made clothing, but as a matter of
fact only the very cheapest of the ready-made trade is
associated with the sweat-shop. Years ago some of the
better shops declared a crusade against such labour and
tabooed the factories dealing with it. The other big
firms fell in line, and manufacturers, realizing that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
trade was at stake, came up to the mark in respect to
the housing, treatment, and wages of employees.</p>

<p>The manufacturer of the twelve-year record has a
factory absolutely sanitary and treats his nine hundred
employees admirably, even supporting a small hotel in
which he harbours any of his work folk who may be ill or
in trouble and need help. These workers are chiefly
Polish and Russian Jews and Italians, the German
contingent, which was once large, having almost disappeared,
and wages are good. Competent men tailors
are always in demand and can make at least from
fifteen to eighteen dollars a week, while many of them
get as high as from forty to eighty dollars. Some of the
manufacturers have salesmen on the road at fifteen
thousand dollars a year, and even pay as high as twenty-two
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The buyers, too, command large salaries, and these
salaried men very frequently become manufacturers
themselves or open specialty shops for the sale of ready-made
garments. One New York salesman, who has
recently gone into the retail business in a comparatively
small way, cleared one hundred thousand dollars last
year and will do better this year. Another man of
ability went to the head of one of the big dry-goods
houses here and asked for a good position.</p>

<p>"Why don't you open workrooms of your own?" he
was asked. "Haven't you any money?"</p>

<p>"Only twenty-five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"That's enough. Go rent some rooms. We know
what you can do. Let us know when you are ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and we'll place an order with you for four times twenty-five
hundred dollars." That was eleven years ago.
The manufacturer retired with a fortune some time
since and amuses himself now by speculating largely in
real estate.</p>

<p>One of the few dressmaking geniuses in this country
is another manufacturer of ready-made frocks&mdash;but of
the highest class models only. He failed at first,&mdash;possibly
because he <i>was</i> a genius, but nine years ago he took
a fresh start and now he is a millionaire&mdash;but still an
artist. He takes a handful of silk and throws it at a
figure, gives it a pull here, a plait there, and voilà!&mdash;an
effect better than his rivals could obtain through careful
and painstaking labour. In Paris that man would be
great. Here he is merely rich, and his million keeps
him from Paris.</p>

<p>All these stories of success and these business statistics
merely serve to illustrate the point with which the
discussion of ready-made clothing began, the increasing
taste and extravagance of American dress. The American
woman, whether of wealth or of very moderate
means, insists upon having good clothes and is getting
them.</p>

<p>Perhaps she buys them ready-made, perhaps she goes
to Paris for them, perhaps she has them made by dressmakers
who go to Paris for their models, but, in any
case, she has them. For the same amount of money
her mother spent she will obtain better artistic results,&mdash;but
she spends more money than her mother dreamed
of spending and more money than she herself would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
have thought of spending ten years ago. An education
in extravagant dress comes easily to any woman, and
once educated to the topmost notch of the domestic
dress production, the Parisian frock is the American's
next requirement.</p>

<p>There are good dressmakers on this side of the water,
quite good enough to satisfy any save the hyper-fastidious,
but our best dressmakers do not go about their business
as do the best dressmakers of Paris. They are business
men or women, their French fellow craftsmen are artists.
There is in Paris the same type of dressmaker we have
here, but there is, too, the artist dressmaker who is
something higher in the scale, and it is through him that
Paris is the fountain-head of fashion. There is little
original work in dress here. Good workmanship we
have. Our plain tailor work, for example, is the best
in the world; but our makers are content to copy French
ideas and French models and they have no such high
standards as have the sponsors of those models. The
Irish-American dressmaker is said to be, next to the
French, the best in the world, but she adapts, she does
not create. Perhaps in Paris she too might soar, but
here she copies French models well, makes money, and
is content.</p>

<p>In the early spring and in August there is a migration
of American dressmakers. By the hundred they go to
Paris, and buyers from all over the country swell the
crowd. Some of the important buyers have set sail
long before, but they are men who represent extensive
interests, with whom buying is a fine art and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
whose expense account the home firm sets no limitations.</p>

<p>One American buyer, representing the largest importer
of model gowns and cloaks in this country, a man
better known, perhaps, than any of his profession, in the
famous Parisian ateliers, sees the models in these ateliers
before the ordinary buyer is given a glimpse of them.
Yet even then they are no new things to him. He has
seen all of their most striking features before.</p>

<p>He does not drop into Paris with the buying flock,
visit the great dressmaking establishments, and accept
as law and gospel whatever chances to be shown there.
He knows what is what. The dressmakers know that
he knows and treat him accordingly.</p>

<p>For months he has been on a still hunt for the fashions
of the spring that is yet distant. He stopped in Madeira
at the very beginning of the winter season, for he knows,
as the Parisian dressmakers know, that an exclusive
little coterie of the world's smartest folk begins its winter
with a few weeks in Madeira, and that in the Funchal
toilettes are to be found many hints that will become
laws when springtime comes to Paris.</p>

<p>Early in December the hunter follows the trail to
Algiers and on to Cairo, though since the automobile
has made Italian touring a fad, many of the smart folk
spend a part of their winter in motoring, and the Algiers
and Cairo seasons are not quite what they were as
gathering places for the fashion clans.</p>

<p>A little later the cream of the fashionable world is on
the Riviera, and our buyer haunts the Monte Carlo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Casino during February. No smallest fashion straw
escapes his watchful eye. He knows the fashion leaders
of all Europe and America by sight. He can cap each
striking costume with the name of the wearer, and,
probably with the name of the maker, and he uses his
time profitably until, late in the month, the birds of fine
feathers take wing once more. It is almost time for
Auteuil and, from all over the world, fashionable folk
are pouring into Paris.</p>

<p>Spring models are on view there in the great ateliers,
and this American receives respectful attention at the
hands of the dressmakers, for his orders will be large&mdash;and
have been large for many years past. Moreover,
he has by this time a very good idea of what he wants,
and he will demand exclusive models instead of taking
the models prepared for the majority of the dressmaking
and buying pilgrims. He knew many of the autocrats
of fashion when they first put up their signs and, through
the advertisement and backing of his firm, many a Paris
dressmaker now famous obtained the American clientèle
that was the foundation of his fortunes.</p>

<p>A valuable customer this, and there are other Americans
of his class who see the best that Paris has to
offer. Some of the more important American dressmakers
also place large orders, insist upon exclusive
models, and are greeted impressively by the saleswomen;
but the most of the crowd buys as little as possible and
sees as much as it can, and the saleswomen, fully alive
to this fact, make a point of allowing the minor dressmakers
to see as little as is consistent with courteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
treatment. Often a group of little dressmakers will
form a syndicate to buy one model and will go together
to the great establishment. There, being really buyers,
they are politely received, and they all take mental notes
of every fashion hint that comes their way during the
visit. They study Paris fashions, too, wherever they
are to be seen, on the streets, in the theatres, at the
restaurants; and during their summer visit they perhaps
run up to Trouville to see the fashion show there. They
have a jolly time as well as a profitable one, and after
a few weeks come home to spread French fashion news
from Maine to California, and furnish such adaptations
of what they have seen as their varying abilities can
accomplish.</p>

<p>The clever buyer usually stays on in Paris after the
crowd of his countrymen and of European dressmakers
has departed; for the more exclusive models and ideas
are reserved for the delectation of the chic Parisienne
and the private buyer, and he wants to see what is
offered to this clientèle as well as what is shown to the
trade. Finally he too sails for home, where much of
his plunder has arrived before him. American women
often wear a Parisian mode before it has been worn in
Paris, and this is especially true of autumn modes; for
Parisiennes are still away from Paris when American
dressmakers and buyers are securing and sending over
their autumn models, and, too, an American woman
travelling in Europe for the summer may buy her fall
outfit in Paris during August, bring it home and begin
wearing it in September, before Parisiennes have left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
seashore and settled down to thought of fall clothes.
This applies, however, chiefly to the few American
fashion leaders, and a radical Parisian mode seldom
achieves actual popularity in America before late in
the season or perhaps the following season. The models
have been brought over and shown, have been bought
and worn by the knowing and courageous; but the great
crowd of American women is slightly conservative and
hesitates to take up any radical Parisian fad until after
the novelty has become somewhat familiar through being
exploited by the ultra-fashionable few.</p>

<p>One of the greatest Parisian dressmakers said recently
in a private conversation that he never felt confident of
general popularity for an original and striking model
until after seeing it upon one or two of his most chic
American customers.</p>

<p>"I do not know what it is," he said, "but there is
something distinctive about the way an American wears
her clothes,&mdash;a grace, an elegance, but also a naturalness.
A Frenchwoman has a genius for dress, but she
makes up for her toilette. She is supremely artificial;
she will wear anything that is launched and make herself
up to fit the mode. Your American doesn't do that.
She wears her clothes superbly, but the clothes must be
of a kind she can wear. That a Parisienne looks well
in a model means nothing as an indication of what
women in general will think of the innovation; but when
I put the model upon one of my best American customers,
I know at once what to expect. They are lovely
in their chiffons, those Americans, provided they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
possibilities of loveliness. It is a pleasure to dress
them."</p>

<p>There are American women who go to Paris regularly
three times a year to replenish their wardrobes, and
these private American customers are the apple of the
dressmaker's eye. Madame will perhaps be in Paris
only a few days. Everything is made to bend to her
fittings, her own particular saleswoman gives up the
days to her, the heads of the departments are called in
for advice and assistance, the master himself gives the
frocks his personal attention. There is a couch in the
private fitting-room upon which Madame may lie down
if she becomes tired, the daintiest of luncheons will be
served to her there if she has not time or inclination to
go elsewhere. Everything is made so smooth, so agreeable,
and if the bills are large, what is that to the wife
or daughter of an American multi-millionaire? There
are New York women whose dressmaking bills in Paris
run up to fifty and sixty thousand dollars in one year,
but who could afford to spend five hundred thousand a
year on clothes if they chose to do it.</p>

<p>Occasionally nowadays a fashion originates in America
and crosses to Paris. The tourist coat with loose belted
back, the long tailored coat, the walking skirt, the
floating veil&mdash;all these were worn in New York and
later taken up by smart Parisiennes, but the fashion
tide usually sets the other way, and we accept slavishly
what Paris furnishes.</p>

<p>The great French dressmakers to a certain extent
control the fashions, but they work with the manufacturers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
One will see the head of a great silk factory
sitting at a table with Beer or Paquin or Doeuillet in
the Café de Paris, and talking earnestly, seriously.
Materials for the future season are being weighed in the
balance. The artist dressmaker is the manufacturer's
critic, his guide, philosopher, and friend, and in this
close connection lies one of the secrets of artistic French
dressmaking. In Paris one can always obtain the
wherewithal to carry out an idea. If necessary the
manufacturer will make the material expressly for
Monsieur's purpose, and many an exquisite fabric has
begun and ended with one length run through the loom.
The dressmaker and his customer wanted that especial
thing and wanted the gown to be absolutely unique.
Expense was not considered and one can obtain anything
in Paris if one will pay for it. Once an order
came from a great lady in Rome. She wanted a ball
gown such as she described for a certain occasion. The
maker had only three days' time in which to execute the
order, and the quantities of white pansies which must
absolutely be the trimming were not to be found in
Paris. Discouraging? Not in the least. Monsieur set
a multitude of flower-makers at work making white
pansies for him. The frock was finished and sent from
Paris to Rome by a special messenger. Time was too
short to admit of experiments with express companies.</p>

<p>When the American dressmaker or professional buyer
chooses a model, cards to the manufacturers who furnished
the fabric and trimmings for the frock are given
her and she buys the materials for as many duplicates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the model as she expects to make. She buys other
materials, too, laces, buttons, novelties of all kinds, that
will enable her to achieve frocks differing from those of
her rivals, and skilful Parisian buying is to-day a very
vital part of the fashionable American dressmaker's
business. Duties upon the importations are of course
tremendous, and during certain months the New York
Custom House is so choked with French chiffons that
there are maddening delays in getting the boxes through.</p>

<p>Paris would miss les Americaines if they should suddenly
lose their interest in French clothes, but there's
no danger of that event. Paris is the fashion centre
and will continue to be the fashion centre. As for our
women&mdash;each year they grow more ardent in their
worship of the Vanities.</p>
